This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which fixes a similar bug in later versions of tar.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32804","epss":0.87712,"percentile":0.99436,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"6.1.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=6.0.0,<6.1.1 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3jfq-g458-7qm9"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.1.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"0c20af720a6836ce","name":"tar","version":"6.1.0","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:6.1.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@6.1.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-22883","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22883","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf","https://hackerone.com/reports/1043360","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/E4FRS5ZVK4ZQ7XIJQNGIKUXG2DJFHLO7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F45Y7TXSU33MTKB6AGL2Q5V5ZOCNPKOG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HSYFUGKFUSZ27M5TEZ3FKILWTWFJTFAZ/","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/february-2021-security-releases/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210416-0001/","https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html","https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf","https://hackerone.com/reports/1043360","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/E4FRS5ZVK4ZQ7XIJQNGIKUXG2DJFHLO7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F45Y7TXSU33MTKB6AGL2Q5V5ZOCNPKOG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HSYFUGKFUSZ27M5TEZ3FKILWTWFJTFAZ/","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/february-2021-security-releases/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210416-0001/","https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"],"description":"Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when too many connection attempts with an 'unknownProtocol' are established.

This is, in part, accomplished by resolving dependency specifiers defined in `package.json` manifests for dependencies with a specific name, and nesting folders to resolve conflicting dependencies. When multiple dependencies differ only in the case of their name, Arborist's internal data structure saw them as separate items that could coexist within the same level in the `node_modules` hierarchy. However, on case-insensitive file systems (such as macOS and Windows), this is not the case. Combined with a symlink dependency such as `file:/some/path`, this allowed an attacker to create a situation in which arbitrary contents could be written to any location on the filesystem. For example, a package `pwn-a` could define a dependency in their `package.json` file such as `\"foo\": \"file:/some/path\"`. Another package, `pwn-b` could define a dependency such as `FOO: \"file:foo.tgz\"`. On case-insensitive file systems, if `pwn-a` was installed, and then `pwn-b` was installed afterwards, the contents of `foo.tgz` would be written to `/some/path`, and any existing contents of `/some/path` would be removed. Anyone using npm v7.20.6 or earlier on a case-insensitive filesystem is potentially affected. This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-39134","epss":0.01359,"percentile":0.79259,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"@npmcli/arborist","version":"2.2.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<2.8.2

npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar.

It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a \"purpose\" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named \"purpose\" values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose.

This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project's `node_modules` folder. If the `node_modules` folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on the file system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are filtered out, so another means of creating a `node_modules` symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A `preinstall` script could replace `node_modules` with a symlink. (This is prevented by using `--ignore-scripts`.) 2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run `npm install --ignore-scripts` in the root. This may be successful, because `npm install --ignore-scripts` is typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe. This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32803","epss":0.00208,"percentile":0.43714,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"6.1.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=6.0.0,<6.1.2 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.1.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"0c20af720a6836ce","name":"tar","version":"6.1.0","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:6.1.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@6.1.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-22025","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22025","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://hackerone.com/reports/2284065","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00029.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240517-0008/","https://hackerone.com/reports/2284065","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00029.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240517-0008/"],"description":"A vulnerability in Node.js has been identified, allowing for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack through resource exhaustion when using the fetch() function to retrieve content from an untrusted URL.\nThe vulnerability stems from the fact that the fetch() function in Node.js always decodes Brotli, making it possible for an attacker to cause resource exhaustion when fetching content from an untrusted URL.\nAn attacker controlling the URL passed into fetch() can exploit this vulnerability to exhaust memory, potentially leading to process termination, depending on the system configuration.","cvss":[{"source":"support@hackerone.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-22025","epss":0.00239,"percentile":0.47244,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["18.19.1","20.11.1","21.6.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.137425},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:15.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"15.9.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-22025","versionConstraint":"< 18.19.1,>= 19, < 20.11.1,>= 21, < 21.6.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"18.19.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"c804c488f5024cc0","name":"node","version":"15.9.0","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/node","accessPath":"/bin/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:15.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/node@15.9.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-36138","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36138","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/july-2024-security-releases","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241108-0010/"],"description":"Bypass incomplete fix of CVE-2024-27980, that arises from improper handling of batch files with all possible extensions on Windows via child_process.spawn / child_process.spawnSync.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 \"short path\" counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include a directory with one form of the path, followed by a symbolic link with a different string that resolves to the same file system entity, followed by a file using the first form. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink that had a different apparent name that resolved to the same entry in the filesystem, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.
