npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.1, 5.0.6, 4.4.14, and 3.3.2 has a arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability due to insufficient absolute path sanitization. node-tar aims to prevent extraction of absolute file paths by turning absolute paths into relative paths when the `preservePaths` flag is not set to `true`. This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which fixes a similar bug in later versions of tar.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32804","epss":0.87712,"percentile":0.99436,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"2.2.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<3.2.2 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3jfq-g458-7qm9"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.2.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a0022407fcc94586","name":"tar","version":"2.2.1","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:2.2.1:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@2.2.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-7chv-rrw6-w6fc","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7chv-rrw6-w6fc","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"XStream is vulnerable to a Remote Command Execution attack","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-29505","epss":0.91356,"percentile":0.99644,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.4.17"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":68.51700000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2021-29505","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29505","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/commit/24fac82191292c6ae25f94508d28b9823f83624f","https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/commit/f0c4a8d861b68ffc3119cfbbbd632deee624e227","https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-7chv-rrw6-w6fc","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r8ee51debf7fd184b6a6b020dc31df25118b0aa612885f12fbe77f04f@%3Cdev.jmeter.apache.org%3E","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/07/msg00004.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/22KVR6B5IZP3BGQ3HPWIO2FWWCKT3DHP","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PVPHZA7VW2RRSDCOIPP2W6O5ND254TU7","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QGXIU3YDPG6OGTDHMBLAFN7BPBERXREB","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210708-0007","https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5004","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html","https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-29505.html","https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/commit/24fac82191292c6ae25f94508d28b9823f83624f","https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-7chv-rrw6-w6fc","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r8ee51debf7fd184b6a6b020dc31df25118b0aa612885f12fbe77f04f%40%3Cdev.jmeter.apache.org%3E","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/07/msg00004.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/22KVR6B5IZP3BGQ3HPWIO2FWWCKT3DHP/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PVPHZA7VW2RRSDCOIPP2W6O5ND254TU7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QGXIU3YDPG6OGTDHMBLAFN7BPBERXREB/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210708-0007/","https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5004","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"],"description":"XStream is software for serializing Java objects to XML and back again.

XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.8,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":6,"exploitabilityScore":6.9,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.8,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-39141","epss":0.75915,"percentile":0.98845,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"xstream","version":"1.4.3"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.4.18 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-g5w6-mrj7-75h2"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.4.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"14ebf15bd4c7b28e","name":"xstream","version":"1.4.3","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/kurento-one2many-call/node_modules/kurento-jsonrpc/m2/repository/com/thoughtworks/xstream/xstream/1.4.3/xstream-1.4.3.jar","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/kurento-one2many-call/node_modules/kurento-jsonrpc/m2/repository/com/thoughtworks/xstream/xstream/1.4.3/xstream-1.4.3.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:com.thoughtworks.xstream:xstream:1.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:thoughtworks:xstream:1.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:xstream:xstream:1.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/com.thoughtworks.xstream/xstream@1.4.3","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/lib/node_modules/kurento-one2many-call/node_modules/kurento-jsonrpc/m2/repository/com/thoughtworks/xstream/xstream/1.4.3/xstream-1.4.3.jar","pomArtifactID":"xstream","pomGroupID":"com.thoughtworks.xstream","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"3427c153a5ad0f2cfa923528ad8be875c8cb1cff"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-fp5r-v3w9-4333","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fp5r-v3w9-4333","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"JMSAppender in Log4j 1.2 is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-4104","epss":0.73689,"percentile":0.98739,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":55.26675000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2021-4104","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-4104","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/18/3","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-4104","https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608#issuecomment-990494126","https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2021-0033","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-02","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-16","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-02","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-04","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211223-0007/","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-44228","https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/930724","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/18/3","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-4104","https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608#issuecomment-990494126","https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2021-0033","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-02","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-16","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-02","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-04","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211223-0007/","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-44228","https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/930724","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"],"description":"JMSAppender in Log4j 1.2 is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data when the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration.

In XStream before version 1.4.15, a Server-Side Forgery Request vulnerability can be activated when unmarshalling. The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to request data from internal resources that are not publicly available only by manipulating the processed input stream. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.15. The reported vulnerability does not exist if running Java 15 or higher.

Maven will follow repositories that are defined in a dependency’s Project Object Model (pom) which may be surprising to some users, resulting in potential risk if a malicious actor takes over that

Maven will follow repositories that are defined in a dependency’s Project Object Model (pom) which may be surprising to some users, resulting in potential risk if a malicious actor takes over that

Maven will follow repositories that are defined in a dependency’s Project Object Model (pom) which may be surprising to some users, resulting in potential risk if a malicious actor takes over that

Prior to version 4.8.0, using AbstractUnArchiver for extracting an archive might lead to an arbitrary file creation and possibly remote code execution. When extracting an archive with an entry that already exists in the destination directory as a symbolic link whose target does not exist - the `resolveFile()` function will return the symlink's source instead of its target, which will pass the verification that ensures the file will not be extracted outside of the destination directory.

Node.js including 6.x before 6.17.0, 8.x before 8.15.1, 10.x before 10.15.2, and 11.x before 11.10.1, an attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by establishing an HTTP or HTTPS connection in

If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-21344","epss":0.28576,"percentile":0.96281,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"xstream","version":"1.4.3"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.4.16 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-59jw-jqf4-3wq3"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.4.16"}}],"artifact":{"id":"14ebf15bd4c7b28e","name":"xstream","version":"1.4.3","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/kurento-one2many-call/node_modules/kurento-jsonrpc/m2/repository/com/thoughtworks/xstream/xstream/1.4.3/xstream-1.4.3.jar","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/kurento-one2many-call/node_modules/kurento-jsonrpc/m2/repository/com/thoughtworks/xstream/xstream/1.4.3/xstream-1.4.3.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:com.thoughtworks.xstream:xstream:1.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:thoughtworks:xstream:1.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:xstream:xstream:1.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/com.thoughtworks.xstream/xstream@1.4.3","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/lib/node_modules/kurento-one2many-call/node_modules/kurento-jsonrpc/m2/repository/com/thoughtworks/xstream/xstream/1.4.3/xstream-1.4.3.jar","pomArtifactID":"xstream","pomGroupID":"com.thoughtworks.xstream","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"3427c153a5ad0f2cfa923528ad8be875c8cb1cff"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-65fg-84f6-3jq3","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-65fg-84f6-3jq3","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"Critical","urls":[],"description":"SQL Injection in Log4j 1.2.x","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-23305","epss":0.1499,"percentile":0.94228,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":14.0906},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-23305","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23305","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/18/4","https://lists.apache.org/thread/pt6lh3pbsvxqlwlp4c5l798dv2hkc85y","https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/index.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220217-0007/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/18/4","https://lists.apache.org/thread/pt6lh3pbsvxqlwlp4c5l798dv2hkc85y","https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/index.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220217-0007/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"],"description":"By design, the JDBCAppender in Log4j 1.2.x accepts an SQL statement as a configuration parameter where the values to be inserted are converters from PatternLayout.

is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th generation). Note: The impact from this issue is similar to CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2015-3193. OpenSSL version 1.0.2-1.0.2m and 1.1.0-1.1.0g are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time. The fix will be included in OpenSSL 1.1.0h when it becomes available. The fix is also available in commit e502cc86d in the OpenSSL git repository.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.3,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2017-3738","epss":0.11761,"percentile":0.93345,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["4.8.7","6.12.2","8.9.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":5.939305},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:6.10.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"6.10.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2017-3738","versionConstraint":">=

serializes Java objects to XML and back again. Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":4.3},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41966","epss":0.05011,"percentile":0.89248,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"xstream","version":"1.4.3"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.4.20 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-j563-grx4-pjpv"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.4.20"}}],"artifact":{"id":"14ebf15bd4c7b28e","name":"xstream","version":"1.4.3","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/kurento-one2many-call/node_modules/kurento-jsonrpc/m2/repository/com/thoughtworks/xstream/xstream/1.4.3/xstream-1.4.3.jar","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/kurento-one2many-call/node_modules/kurento-jsonrpc/m2/repository/com/thoughtworks/xstream/xstream/1.4.3/xstream-1.4.3.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:com.thoughtworks.xstream:xstream:1.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:thoughtworks:xstream:1.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:xstream:xstream:1.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/com.thoughtworks.xstream/xstream@1.4.3","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/lib/node_modules/kurento-one2many-call/node_modules/kurento-jsonrpc/m2/repository/com/thoughtworks/xstream/xstream/1.4.3/xstream-1.4.3.jar","pomArtifactID":"xstream","pomGroupID":"com.thoughtworks.xstream","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"3427c153a5ad0f2cfa923528ad8be875c8cb1cff"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-hrpp-h998-j3pp","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hrpp-h998-j3pp","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"qs vulnerable to Prototype Pollution","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-24999","epss":0.05114,"percentile":0.89367,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.2.4"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":3.8355},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-24999","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24999","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/expressjs/express/releases/tag/4.17.3","https://github.com/ljharb/qs/pull/428","https://github.com/n8tz/CVE-2022-24999","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00039.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230908-0005/","https://github.com/expressjs/express/releases/tag/4.17.3","https://github.com/ljharb/qs/pull/428","https://github.com/n8tz/CVE-2022-24999","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00039.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230908-0005/"],"description":"qs before 6.10.3, as used in Express before 4.17.3 and other products, allows attackers to cause a Node process hang for an Express application because an __ proto__ key can be used.

an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL_shutdown() twice (once to send a close_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable \"non-stitched\" ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway).

npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-37713","epss":0.00938,"percentile":0.75192,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"2.2.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<4.4.18

In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability where the processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. XStream creates therefore new instances based on these type information.

The HTTP specification does not allow for spaces in the `Content-Length` value and the Node.js HTTP parser has been brought into line on this particular difference. The security risk of this flaw to Node.js users is considered to be VERY LOW as it is difficult, and may be impossible, to craft an attack that makes use of this flaw in a way that could not already be achieved by supplying an incorrect value for `Content-Length`. Vulnerabilities may exist in user-code that make incorrect assumptions about the potential accuracy of this value compared to the actual length of the data supplied.

In affected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream. A user is only affected if using the version out of the box with JDK 1.7u21 or below.

Spring Security 3.2.x, 4.0.x, 4.1.0 and the Spring Framework 3.2.x, 4.0.x, 4.1.x, 4.2.x rely on URL pattern mappings for authorization and for mapping requests to controllers respectively. Differences in the strictness of the pattern matching mechanisms, for example with regards to space trimming in path segments, can lead Spring Security to not recognize certain paths as not protected that are in fact mapped to Spring MVC controllers that should be protected. The problem is compounded by the fact that the Spring Framework provides richer features with regards to pattern matching as well as by the fact that pattern matching in each Spring Security and the Spring Framework can easily be customized creating additional differences.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2016-5007","epss":0.00291,"percentile":0.52258,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"spring-core","version":"3.2.5.RELEASE"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<4.3.1

of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.4 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Overwrite. It fails to prevent existing globally-installed binaries to be overwritten by other package installations. For example, if a package was installed globally and created a serve binary, any subsequent installs of packages that also create a serve binary would overwrite the previous serve binary. This behavior is still allowed in local installations and also through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":8,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.7,"exploitabilityScore":1.3,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-16777","epss":0.00287,"percentile":0.52016,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"npm","version":"3.10.10"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<6.13.4

With buffers in node when you allocate it when a number instead of a string it will allocate the amount of bytes.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2016-10518","epss":0.0045,"percentile":0.62738,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"ws","version":"0.4.32"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.0.1 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-2mhh-w6q8-5hxw"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.0.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"5ace919e35857b26","name":"ws","version":"0.4.32","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/kurento-one2many-call/node_modules/kurento-jsonrpc/node_modules/ws/package.json","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/kurento-one2many-call/node_modules/kurento-jsonrpc/node_modules/ws/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:ws_project:ws:0.4.32:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/ws@0.4.32","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-x8qc-rrcw-4r46","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x8qc-rrcw-4r46","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"npm symlink reference outside of node_modules","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.7,"exploitabilityScore":1.3,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-16776","epss":0.00177,"percentile":0.40055,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.13.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.13452000000000003},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2019-16776","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16776","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00027.html","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2020:0330","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0573","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0579","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0597","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0602","https://blog.npmjs.org/post/189618601100/binary-planting-with-the-npm-cli","https://github.com/npm/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-x8qc-rrcw-4r46","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z36UKPO5F3PQ3Q2POMF5LEKXWAH5RUFP/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00027.html","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2020:0330","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0573","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0579","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0597","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0602","https://blog.npmjs.org/post/189618601100/binary-planting-with-the-npm-cli","https://github.com/npm/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-x8qc-rrcw-4r46","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z36UKPO5F3PQ3Q2POMF5LEKXWAH5RUFP/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html"],"description":"Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.3 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Write.

Users unable to upgrade may catch the StackOverflowError in the client code calling XStream if XStream is configured to use the BinaryStreamDriver.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-47072","epss":0.00132,"percentile":0.3417,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"xstream","version":"1.4.3"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.4.21 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-hfq9-hggm-c56q"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.4.21"}}],"artifact":{"id":"14ebf15bd4c7b28e","name":"xstream","version":"1.4.3","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/kurento-one2many-call/node_modules/kurento-jsonrpc/m2/repository/com/thoughtworks/xstream/xstream/1.4.3/xstream-1.4.3.jar","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/kurento-one2many-call/node_modules/kurento-jsonrpc/m2/repository/com/thoughtworks/xstream/xstream/1.4.3/xstream-1.4.3.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:com.thoughtworks.xstream:xstream:1.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:thoughtworks:xstream:1.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:xstream:xstream:1.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/com.thoughtworks.xstream/xstream@1.4.3","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/lib/node_modules/kurento-one2many-call/node_modules/kurento-jsonrpc/m2/repository/com/thoughtworks/xstream/xstream/1.4.3/xstream-1.4.3.jar","pomArtifactID":"xstream","pomGroupID":"com.thoughtworks.xstream","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"3427c153a5ad0f2cfa923528ad8be875c8cb1cff"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-27982","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27982","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://hackerone.com/reports/2237099","https://hackerone.com/reports/2237099","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250418-0001/"],"description":"The team has identified a critical vulnerability in the http server of the most recent version of Node, where malformed headers can lead to HTTP request smuggling.

is an HTTP authentication scheme providing mechanisms for making authenticated HTTP requests with partial cryptographic verification of the request and response, covering the HTTP method, request URI, host, and optionally the request payload. Hawk used a regular expression to parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker's input increases the computation time exponentially. `parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead. `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host` and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-29167","epss":0.00092,"percentile":0.27258,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"hawk","version":"3.1.3"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<9.0.1

XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.8,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:C","metrics":{"baseScore":6.3,"exploitabilityScore":6.9,"impactScore":6.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-39140","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26739,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"xstream","version":"1.4.3"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.4.18 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-6wf9-jmg9-vxcc"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.4.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"14ebf15bd4c7b28e","name":"xstream","version":"1.4.3","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/kurento-one2many-call/node_modules/kurento-jsonrpc/m2/repository/com/thoughtworks/xstream/xstream/1.4.3/xstream-1.4.3.jar","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/kurento-one2many-call/node_modules/kurento-jsonrpc/m2/repository/com/thoughtworks/xstream/xstream/1.4.3/xstream-1.4.3.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:com.thoughtworks.xstream:xstream:1.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:thoughtworks:xstream:1.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:xstream:xstream:1.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/com.thoughtworks.xstream/xstream@1.4.3","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/lib/node_modules/kurento-one2many-call/node_modules/kurento-jsonrpc/m2/repository/com/thoughtworks/xstream/xstream/1.4.3/xstream-1.4.3.jar","pomArtifactID":"xstream","pomGroupID":"com.thoughtworks.xstream","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"3427c153a5ad0f2cfa923528ad8be875c8cb1cff"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-282f-qqgm-c34q","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-282f-qqgm-c34q","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Prototype Pollution in node-jsonpointer","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.6,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-23807","epss":0.00093,"percentile":0.27599,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["5.0.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.04929},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2021-23807","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23807","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://github.com/janl/node-jsonpointer/commit/a0345f3550cd9c4d89f33b126390202b89510ad4","https://github.com/janl/node-jsonpointer/pull/51","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-1910273","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JSONPOINTER-1577288","https://github.com/janl/node-jsonpointer/commit/a0345f3550cd9c4d89f33b126390202b89510ad4","https://github.com/janl/node-jsonpointer/pull/51","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-1910273","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JSONPOINTER-1577288"],"description":"This affects the package jsonpointer before 5.0.0.

temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.1,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cve-coordination@google.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-8908","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.0049,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"guava","version":"15.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<32.0.0-android
