This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which fixes a similar bug in later versions of tar.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32804","epss":0.87712,"percentile":0.99436,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"4.4.13"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=4.0.0,<4.4.14 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3jfq-g458-7qm9"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"4.4.14"}}],"artifact":{"id":"518d9ab0729e5f46","name":"tar","version":"4.4.13","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:4.4.13:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@4.4.13","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-22883","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22883","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf","https://hackerone.com/reports/1043360","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/E4FRS5ZVK4ZQ7XIJQNGIKUXG2DJFHLO7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F45Y7TXSU33MTKB6AGL2Q5V5ZOCNPKOG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HSYFUGKFUSZ27M5TEZ3FKILWTWFJTFAZ/","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/february-2021-security-releases/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210416-0001/","https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html","https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf","https://hackerone.com/reports/1043360","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/E4FRS5ZVK4ZQ7XIJQNGIKUXG2DJFHLO7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F45Y7TXSU33MTKB6AGL2Q5V5ZOCNPKOG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HSYFUGKFUSZ27M5TEZ3FKILWTWFJTFAZ/","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/february-2021-security-releases/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210416-0001/","https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"],"description":"Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when too many connection attempts with an 'unknownProtocol' are established.

Users are advised to find an alternative software.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":10,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-37903","epss":0.35568,"percentile":0.96877,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"vm2","version":"3.9.19"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<=3.9.19 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-g644-9gfx-q4q4"}}],"artifact":{"id":"7f42bcd250452616","name":"vm2","version":"3.9.19","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/vm2/package.json","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/vm2/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:vm2_project:vm2:3.9.19:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/vm2@3.9.19","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-32214","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32214","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://hackerone.com/reports/1524692","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/july-2022-security-releases/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5326","https://hackerone.com/reports/1524692","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/july-2022-security-releases/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5326"],"description":"The llhttp parser <v14.20.1, <v16.17.1 and <v18.9.1 in the http module in Node.js does not strictly use the CRLF sequence to delimit HTTP requests.

BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m).

npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-37713","epss":0.00938,"percentile":0.75192,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"4.4.13"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<4.4.18

X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a \"purpose\" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named \"purpose\" values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.

There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-28849","epss":0.00121,"percentile":0.32429,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"follow-redirects","version":"1.15.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<=1.15.5 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-cxjh-pqwp-8mfp"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.15.6"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a3748a1534332c71","name":"follow-redirects","version":"1.15.2","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/follow-redirects/package.json","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/follow-redirects/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:follow-redirects:follow_redirects:1.15.2:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/follow-redirects@1.15.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-q2x7-8rv6-6q7h","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q2x7-8rv6-6q7h","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Jinja has a sandbox breakout through indirect reference to format method","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-56326","epss":0.00103,"percentile":0.29451,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.1.5"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.06592},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-56326","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56326","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/pallets/jinja/commit/48b0687e05a5466a91cd5812d604fa37ad0943b4","https://github.com/pallets/jinja/releases/tag/3.1.5","https://github.com/pallets/jinja/security/advisories/GHSA-q2x7-8rv6-6q7h"],"description":"Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.5, An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to store a reference to a malicious string's format method, then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja, but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":5.4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-56326","epss":0.00103,"percentile":0.29451,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"jinja2","version":"3.1.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<=3.1.4

In versions on the 3.x branch prior to 3.1.5, a bug in the Jinja compiler allows an attacker that controls both the content and filename of a template to execute arbitrary Python code, regardless of if Jinja's sandbox is used. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control both the filename and the contents of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates where the template author can also choose the template filename. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":5.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-56201","epss":0.00064,"percentile":0.20401,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"jinja2","version":"3.1.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=3.0.0,<=3.1.4 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-gmj6-6f8f-6699"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.1.5"}}],"artifact":{"id":"977308c412e54ffd","name":"jinja2","version":"3.1.2","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/Jinja2-3.1.2.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/Jinja2-3.1.2.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/Jinja2-3.1.2.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/Jinja2-3.1.2.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/Jinja2-3.1.2.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/Jinja2-3.1.2.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher_project:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher_project:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacherproject:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacherproject:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher_project:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin-ronacher:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin-ronacher:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacherproject:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-jinja2:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-jinja2:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_jinja2:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_jinja2:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin-ronacher:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jinja2:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jinja2:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-jinja2:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_jinja2:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jinja2:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/jinja2@3.1.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-23166","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23166","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/may-2025-security-releases"],"description":"The C++ method SignTraits::DeriveBits() may incorrectly call ThrowException() based on user-supplied inputs when executing in a background thread, crashing the Node.js process.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 \"short path\" counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include a directory with one form of the path, followed by a symbolic link with a different string that resolves to the same file system entity, followed by a file using the first form. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink that had a different apparent name that resolved to the same entry in the filesystem, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar.

Prior to 3.1.6, an oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment interacts with the |attr filter allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit. A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. If this is not possible, a workaround is available in the referenced GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-37701","epss":0.00016,"percentile":0.02438,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"4.4.13"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=3.0.0,<4.4.16 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"4.4.16"}}],"artifact":{"id":"518d9ab0729e5f46","name":"tar","version":"4.4.13","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:4.4.13:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@4.4.13","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-pxg6-pf52-xh8x","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pxg6-pf52-xh8x","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"cookie accepts cookie name, path, and domain with out of bounds characters","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-47764","epss":0.0004,"percentile":0.11409,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.7.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.012},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-47764","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47764","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/jshttp/cookie/commit/e10042845354fea83bd8f34af72475eed1dadf5c","https://github.com/jshttp/cookie/pull/167","https://github.com/jshttp/cookie/security/advisories/GHSA-pxg6-pf52-xh8x"],"description":"cookie is a basic HTTP cookie parser and serializer for HTTP servers.

When using versions of Babel prior to 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17 to compile regular expression named capturing groups, Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`). Generated code is vulnerable if all the following conditions are true: Using Babel to compile regular expression named capturing groups, using the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups, and the code using untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`. This problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17. It's likely that individual users do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees use of a new enough `@babel/helpers` version. Note that just updating Babel dependencies is not enough; one will also need to re-compile the code.
