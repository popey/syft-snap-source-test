A vulnerability in versions prior to `17.0.0-alpha.6`, `16.0.6`, `15.3.5`, `14.2.4`, and `13.6.6` allows renderers to obtain access to a bluetooth device via the web bluetooth API if the app has not configured a custom `select-bluetooth-device` event handler. This has been patched and Electron versions `17.0.0-alpha.6`, `16.0.6`, `15.3.5`, `14.2.4`, and `13.6.6` contain the fix. Code from the GitHub Security Advisory can be added to the app to work around the issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":3.2,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4,"exploitabilityScore":8,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.4,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-21718","epss":0.00398,"percentile":0.59809,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"electron","version":"9.3.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<13.6.6 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3p22-ghq8-v749"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"13.6.6"}}],"artifact":{"id":"2d7ee06d781c9258","name":"electron","version":"9.3.1","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/resources/app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/electron/package.json","accessPath":"/resources/app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/electron/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:electronjs:electron:9.3.1:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/electron@9.3.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-77xc-hjv8-ww97","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-77xc-hjv8-ww97","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"AutoUpdater module fails to validate certain nested components of the bundle","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.6,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-29257","epss":0.00109,"percentile":0.30419,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["15.5.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.06322},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-29257","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29257","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-77xc-hjv8-ww97","https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-77xc-hjv8-ww97"],"description":"Electron is a framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript (JS), HTML, and CSS.

A vulnerability in versions prior to 18.0.0-beta.6, 17.2.0, 16.2.6, and 15.5.5 allows a renderer with JS execution to obtain access to a new renderer process with `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` enabled which in turn allows effective access to `ipcRenderer`. The `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` option does not implicitly grant Node.js access. Rather, it depends on the existing sandbox setting. If an application is sandboxed, then `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` just gives access to the sandboxed renderer APIs, which include `ipcRenderer`.
