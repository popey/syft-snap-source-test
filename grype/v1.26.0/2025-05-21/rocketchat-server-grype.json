SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC).

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including versions 1.0.1 and 2.2.1 does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse` should restrict parsing of `__proto__` keys when parsing JSON strings to objects.

The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including versions 1.0.1 and 2.2.1 does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse` should restrict parsing of `__proto__` keys when parsing JSON strings to objects.

is a JavaScript library of crypto standards. Prior to version 4.2.0, crypto-js PBKDF2 is 1,000 times weaker than originally specified in 1993, and at least 1,300,000 times weaker than current industry standard. This is because it both defaults to SHA1, a cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure since at least 2005, and defaults to one single iteration, a 'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1,000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on iteration count as a countermeasure to preimage and collision attacks. If used to protect passwords, the impact is high. If used to generate signatures, the impact is high. Version 4.2.0 contains a patch for this issue.

is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. In versions prior to 19.4.0 events sent with special strings in key places can temporarily disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to the consumer. This issue has been fixed in matrix-js-sdk 19.4.0 and users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by redacting applicable events, waiting for the sync processor to store data, and restarting the client. Alternatively, redacting the applicable events and clearing all storage will often fix most perceived issues. In some cases, no workarounds are possible.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":4.3},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-36059","epss":0.00869,"percentile":0.7416,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"matrix-js-sdk","version":"12.5.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<19.4.0

Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12.

Set server.maxHeadersCount to 0 so that no limit is applied.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37890","epss":0.0032,"percentile":0.54565,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"ws","version":"8.13.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=8.0.0,<8.17.1

is the instrumentation library for Go applications in Prometheus, and the promhttp package in client_golang provides tooling around HTTP servers and clients. In client_golang prior to version 1.11.1, HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an instrumented software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except `RequestsInFlight`; not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware; pass metric with `method` label name to our middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown `method`. client_golang version 1.11.1 contains a patch for this issue. Several workarounds are available, including removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp handlers; adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request method given by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy or web application firewall, configured to only allow a limited set of methods.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-21698","epss":0.00227,"percentile":0.45748,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/prometheus/client_golang","version":"v1.10.1-0.20210603120351-253906201bda"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.11.1 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-cg3q-j54f-5p7p"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.11.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"5efe0a0c55619258","name":"github.com/prometheus/client_golang","version":"v1.10.1-0.20210603120351-253906201bda","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/caddy2","accessPath":"/bin/caddy2","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:prometheus:client-golang:v1.10.1-0.20210603120351-253906201bda:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:prometheus:client_golang:v1.10.1-0.20210603120351-253906201bda:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/prometheus/client_golang@v1.10.1-0.20210603120351-253906201bda","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.5","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:3W1P84xhSTIfDWfFnKN84yPp6iPXmvSgwfQe4heKOM8=","mainModule":"caddy"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-45290","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45290","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/569341","https://go.dev/issue/65383","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2599","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0004/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/569341","https://go.dev/issue/65383","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2599","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0004/"],"description":"When parsing a multipart form (either explicitly with Request.ParseMultipartForm or implicitly with Request.FormValue, Request.PostFormValue, or Request.FormFile), limits on the total size of the parsed form were not applied to the memory consumed while reading a single form line.

is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript. In matrix-js-sdk versions versions 9.11.0 through 34.7.0, the method `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys` is vulnerable to interception by malicious homeservers.  The method was introduced by MSC3061) and is commonly used to share historical message keys with newly invited users, granting them access to past messages in the room. However, it unconditionally sends these \"shared\" keys to all of the invited user's devices, regardless of whether the user's cryptographic identity is verified or whether the user's devices are signed by that identity. This allows the attacker to potentially inject its own devices to receive sensitive historical keys without proper security checks. Note that this only affects clients running the SDK with the legacy crypto stack. Clients using the new Rust cryptography stack (i.e. those that call `MatrixClient.initRustCrypto()` instead of `MatrixClient.initCrypto()`) are unaffected by this vulnerability, because `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys()` raises an exception in such environments. The vulnerability was fixed in matrix-js-sdk 34.8.0 by removing the vulnerable functionality. As a workaround, remove use of affected functionality from clients.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":8.7},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-47080","epss":0.00211,"percentile":0.44063,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"matrix-js-sdk","version":"12.5.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=9.11.0,<34.8.0 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4jf8-g8wp-cx7c"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"34.8.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"069917c659d5cbf3","name":"matrix-js-sdk","version":"12.5.0","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/programs/server/npm/node_modules/matrix-js-sdk/package.json","accessPath":"/programs/server/npm/node_modules/matrix-js-sdk/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:matrix-js-sdk:matrix-js-sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix-js-sdk:matrix_js_sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix_js_sdk:matrix-js-sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix_js_sdk:matrix_js_sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix-org:matrix-js-sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix-org:matrix_js_sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix-js:matrix-js-sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix-js:matrix_js_sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix_js:matrix-js-sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix_js:matrix_js_sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix:matrix-js-sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix:matrix_js_sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/matrix-js-sdk@12.5.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-24791","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24791","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/591255","https://go.dev/issue/67555","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/t0rK-qHBqzY/m/6MMoAZkMAgAJ","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2963","https://go.dev/cl/591255","https://go.dev/issue/67555","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/t0rK-qHBqzY/m/6MMoAZkMAgAJ","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2963","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241004-0004/"],"description":"The net/http HTTP/1.1 client mishandled the case where a server responds to a request with an \"Expect: 100-continue\" header with a non-informational (200 or higher) status.

Javascript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. Prior to version 19.7.0, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another person, without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally, a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user. This can allow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification, to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm.

JavaScript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server software development kit (SDK) for JavaScript. Prior to version 19.7.0, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could interfere with the verification flow between two users, injecting its own cross-signing user identity in place of one of the users’ identities. This would lead to the other device trusting/verifying the user identity under the control of the homeserver instead of the intended one. The vulnerability is a bug in the matrix-js-sdk, caused by checking and signing user identities and devices in two separate steps, and inadequately fixing the keys to be signed between those steps. Even though the attack is partly made possible due to the design decision of treating cross-signing user identities as Matrix devices on the server side (with their device ID set to the public part of the user identity key), no other examined implementations were vulnerable. Starting with version 19.7.0, the matrix-js-sdk has been modified to double check that the key signed is the one that was verified instead of just referencing the key by ID.

Javascript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. Prior to version 19.7.0, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages appearing to have come from another person. Such messages will be marked with a grey shield on some platforms, but this may be missing in others. This attack is possible due to the matrix-js-sdk implementing a too permissive key forwarding strategy on the receiving end. Starting with version 19.7.0, the default policy for accepting key forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-js-sdk. matrix-js-sdk will now only accept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests and only from own, verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the decrypted message upon decryption, based on whether the key used to decrypt the message was received from a trusted source. Clients need to ensure that messages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are decorated appropriately, for example, by showing a warning for such messages. This attack requires coordination between a malicious homeserver and an attacker, and those who trust your homeservers do not need a workaround.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-39249","epss":0.00127,"percentile":0.3343,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"matrix-js-sdk","version":"12.5.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<19.7.0 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-6263-x97c-c4gg"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"19.7.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"069917c659d5cbf3","name":"matrix-js-sdk","version":"12.5.0","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/programs/server/npm/node_modules/matrix-js-sdk/package.json","accessPath":"/programs/server/npm/node_modules/matrix-js-sdk/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:matrix-js-sdk:matrix-js-sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix-js-sdk:matrix_js_sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix_js_sdk:matrix-js-sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix_js_sdk:matrix_js_sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix-org:matrix-js-sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix-org:matrix_js_sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix-js:matrix-js-sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix-js:matrix_js_sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix_js:matrix-js-sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix_js:matrix_js_sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix:matrix-js-sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:matrix:matrix_js_sdk:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/matrix-js-sdk@12.5.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-27982","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27982","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://hackerone.com/reports/2237099","https://hackerone.com/reports/2237099","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250418-0001/"],"description":"The team has identified a critical vulnerability in the http server of the most recent version of Node, where malformed headers can lead to HTTP request smuggling.

An attacker present in a room where an MSC3401 group call is taking place can eavesdrop on the video and audio of participants using matrix-js-sdk, without their knowledge. To affected matrix-js-sdk users, the attacker will not appear to be participating in the call. This attack is possible because matrix-js-sdk's group call implementation accepts incoming direct calls from other users, even if they have not yet declared intent to participate in the group call, as a means of resolving a race condition in call setup. Affected versions do not restrict access to the user's outbound media in this case. Legacy 1:1 calls are unaffected. This is fixed in matrix-js-sdk 24.1.0.

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26636,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20190930134127-c5a3c61f89f3"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26636,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20210525063256-abc453219eb5"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.17.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"7311abf84c725860","name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20210525063256-abc453219eb5","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/caddy2","accessPath":"/bin/caddy2","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:networking:v0.0.0-20210525063256-abc453219eb5:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/net@v0.0.0-20210525063256-abc453219eb5","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.5","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:wjuX4b5yYQnEQHzd+CBcrcC6OVR2J1CN6mUy0oSxIPo=","mainModule":"caddy"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-7p89-p6hx-q4fw","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7p89-p6hx-q4fw","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"basic-auth-connect's callback uses time unsafe string comparison","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-47178","epss":0.00088,"percentile":0.26556,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.1.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.066},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-47178","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47178","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/expressjs/basic-auth-connect/commit/bac1e6a8530e1efd0028800b9b588a37adb0d203","https://github.com/expressjs/basic-auth-connect/security/advisories/GHSA-7p89-p6hx-q4fw"],"description":"basic-auth-connect is Connect's Basic Auth middleware in its own module. basic-auth-connect < 1.1.0 uses a timing-unsafe equality comparison that can leak timing information.

In `@babel/traverse` prior to versions 7.23.2 and 8.0.0-alpha.4 and all versions of `babel-traverse`, using Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation, when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods. Known affected plugins are `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`; `@babel/preset-env` when using its `useBuiltIns` option; and any \"polyfill provider\" plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`, such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`.

For example, it could be used to alter critical identity or access control attributes, enabling an attacker to escalate privileges or impersonate another user.

Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41725","epss":0.00051,"percentile":0.15977,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.6"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.038250000000000006},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.17.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.17.3"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-41725","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.6,= 1.20.0,= 1.20.0-rc1,= 1.20.0-rc2,= 1.20.0-rc3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.6"}}],"artifact":{"id":"cf901bbe51b05b70","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.17.3","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/yq","accessPath":"/bin/yq","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.17.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.17.3","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.17.3","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-22019","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22019","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1","https://hackerone.com/reports/2233486","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240315-0004/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1","https://hackerone.com/reports/2233486","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240315-0004/"],"description":"A vulnerability in Node.js HTTP servers allows an attacker to send a specially crafted HTTP request with chunked encoding, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service (DoS).

With fix, header parsing now correctly allocates only the memory required to hold parsed headers.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24534","epss":0.00045,"percentile":0.13323,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.8","1.20.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.03375},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.17.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.17.3"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-24534","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.8,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"cf901bbe51b05b70","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.17.3","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/yq","accessPath":"/bin/yq","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.17.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.17.3","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.17.3","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-41720","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41720","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/455716","https://go.dev/issue/56694","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/L_3rmdT0BMU/m/yZDrXjIiBQAJ","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-1143","https://go.dev/cl/455716","https://go.dev/issue/56694","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/L_3rmdT0BMU/m/yZDrXjIiBQAJ","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-1143"],"description":"On Windows, restricted files can be accessed via os.DirFS and http.Dir.

Upgrade to KaTeX v0.16.10 to remove this vulnerability.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.1,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-28246","epss":0.00051,"percentile":0.15916,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"katex","version":"0.16.7"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=0.11.0,<0.16.10 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3wc5-fcw2-2329"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.16.10"}}],"artifact":{"id":"4d7ae5e5259cc402","name":"katex","version":"0.16.7","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/programs/server/npm/node_modules/katex/package.json","accessPath":"/programs/server/npm/node_modules/katex/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:KaTeX:katex:0.16.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:katex:katex:0.16.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/katex@0.16.7","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-vxvm-qww3-2fh7","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vxvm-qww3-2fh7","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"MongoDB Driver may publish events containing authentication-related data","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32050","epss":0.00058,"percentile":0.18461,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["4.17.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.026680000000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2021-32050","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32050","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CDRIVER-3797","https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CXX-2028","https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3356","https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PHPC-1869","https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SWIFT-1229","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0001/","https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CDRIVER-3797","https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CXX-2028","https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3356","https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PHPC-1869","https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SWIFT-1229","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0001/"],"description":"Some MongoDB Drivers may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application.

versions `<=8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library, lack of algorithm definition in the `jwt.verify()` function can lead to signature validation bypass due to defaulting to the `none` algorithm for signature verification. Users are affected if you do not specify algorithms in the `jwt.verify()` function. This issue has been fixed, please update to version 9.0.0 which removes the default support for the none algorithm in the `jwt.verify()` method. There will be no impact, if you update to version 9.0.0 and you don’t need to allow for the `none` algorithm. If you need 'none' algorithm, you have to explicitly specify that in `jwt.verify()` options.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":7.6,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":4.8},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":6.4,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":4.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-23540","epss":0.00024,"percentile":0.04948,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"jsonwebtoken","version":"8.5.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<9.0.0 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-qwph-4952-7xr6"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"9.0.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"868e5a07405b27d0","name":"jsonwebtoken","version":"8.5.1","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/programs/server/npm/node_modules/jsonwebtoken/package.json","accessPath":"/programs/server/npm/node_modules/jsonwebtoken/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:auth0:jsonwebtoken:8.5.1:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/jsonwebtoken@8.5.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-45341","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45341","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/643099","https://go.dev/issue/71156","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/CAWXhan3Jww/m/bk9LAa-lCgAJ","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/bG8cv1muIBM/m/G461hA6lCgAJ","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3373","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250221-0004/"],"description":"A certificate with a URI which has a IPv6 address with a zone ID may incorrectly satisfy a URI name constraint that applies to the certificate chain.
