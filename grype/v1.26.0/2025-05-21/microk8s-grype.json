X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but\nthe public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type\nof the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by\nthe OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an\nASN1_STRING.\n\nWhen CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the\nX509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass\narbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or\nenact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to\nprovide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a\nvalid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other\ninput must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which\nis uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect\napplications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs\nover a network.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-0286","epss":0.8576,"percentile":0.99335,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"cryptography","version":"2.8"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=0.8.1,<39.0.1 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-x4qr-2fvf-3mr5"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"39.0.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"5db92af054d69cbe","name":"cryptography","version":"2.8","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/cryptography-2.8.egg-info/PKG-INFO","accessPath":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/cryptography-2.8.egg-info/PKG-INFO","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/cryptography-2.8.egg-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/cryptography-2.8.egg-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["BSD or Apache License, Version 2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:cryptography.io:cryptography:2.8:*:*:*:*:python:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cryptography.io:cryptography:2.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/cryptography@2.8","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2007-4559","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-4559","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-August/074290.html","http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-August/074292.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/26623","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/3022","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=263261","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CVBB7NU3YIRRDOKLYVN647WPRR3IAKR6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FI55PGL47ES3OU2FQPGEHOI2EK3S2OBH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KA4Z44ZAI4SY7THCFBUDNT5EEFO4XQ3A/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-06","http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-August/074290.html","http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-August/074292.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/26623","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/3022","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=263261","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CVBB7NU3YIRRDOKLYVN647WPRR3IAKR6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FI55PGL47ES3OU2FQPGEHOI2EK3S2OBH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KA4Z44ZAI4SY7THCFBUDNT5EEFO4XQ3A/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CVBB7NU3YIRRDOKLYVN647WPRR3IAKR6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FI55PGL47ES3OU2FQPGEHOI2EK3S2OBH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KA4Z44ZAI4SY7THCFBUDNT5EEFO4XQ3A/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-06"],"description":"Directory traversal vulnerability in the (1) extract and (2) extractall functions in the tarfile module in Python allows user-assisted remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via a ..

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed.

The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field.

Contrib is a collection of third-party packages for OpenTelemetry-Go. A handler wrapper out of the box adds labels `http.user_agent` and `http.method` that have unbound cardinality. It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent to it. HTTP header User-Agent or HTTP method for requests can be easily set by an attacker to be random and long. The library internally uses `httpconv.ServerRequest` that records every value for HTTP `method` and `User-Agent`. In order to be affected, a program has to use the `otelhttp.NewHandler` wrapper and not filter any unknown HTTP methods or User agents on the level of CDN, LB, previous middleware, etc. Version 0.44.0 fixed this issue when the values collected for attribute `http.request.method` were changed to be restricted to a set of well-known values and other high cardinality attributes were removed. As a workaround to stop being affected, `otelhttp.WithFilter()` can be used, but it requires manual careful configuration to not log certain requests entirely. For convenience and safe usage of this library, it should by default mark with the label `unknown` non-standard HTTP methods and User agents to show that such requests were made but do not increase cardinality. In case someone wants to stay with the current behavior, library API should allow to enable it.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45142","epss":0.00959,"percentile":0.7546,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/github.com/emicklei/go-restful/otelrestful","version":"v0.42.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.44.0 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-rcjv-mgp8-qvmr"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.44.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"5bd5f64f91fb340b","name":"go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/github.com/emicklei/go-restful/otelrestful","version":"v0.42.0","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/kubelite","accessPath":"/kubelite","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:contrib:instrumentation/github.com/emicklei/go-restful/otelrestful:v0.42.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:contrib:instrumentation/github.com/emicklei/go_restful/otelrestful:v0.42.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation@v0.42.0#github.com/emicklei/go-restful/otelrestful","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.23.6","architecture":"amd64","mainModule":"k8s.io/kubernetes"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-q2q7-5pp4-w6pg","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q2q7-5pp4-w6pg","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Catastrophic backtracking in URL authority parser when passed URL containing many @ characters","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-33503","epss":0.00863,"percentile":0.74068,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.26.5"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.6472500000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2021-33503","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33503","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q2q7-5pp4-w6pg","https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/2d4a3fee6de2fa45eb82169361918f759269b4ec","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6SCV7ZNAHS3E6PBFLJGENCDRDRWRZZ6W/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FMUGWEAUYGGHTPPXT6YBD53WYXQGVV73/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-36","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html","https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q2q7-5pp4-w6pg","https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/2d4a3fee6de2fa45eb82169361918f759269b4ec","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6SCV7ZNAHS3E6PBFLJGENCDRDRWRZZ6W/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FMUGWEAUYGGHTPPXT6YBD53WYXQGVV73/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-36","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"],"description":"An issue was discovered in urllib3 before 1.26.5.

This issue has been present since `update_into` was originally introduced in cryptography 1.8.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-23931","epss":0.00331,"percentile":0.55531,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"cryptography","version":"2.8"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=1.8,<39.0.1 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-w7pp-m8wf-vj6r"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"39.0.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"5db92af054d69cbe","name":"cryptography","version":"2.8","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/cryptography-2.8.egg-info/PKG-INFO","accessPath":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/cryptography-2.8.egg-info/PKG-INFO","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/cryptography-2.8.egg-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/cryptography-2.8.egg-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["BSD or Apache License, Version 2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:cryptography.io:cryptography:2.8:*:*:*:*:python:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cryptography.io:cryptography:2.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/cryptography@2.8","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-cx63-2mw6-8hw5","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cx63-2mw6-8hw5","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"setuptools vulnerable to Command Injection via package URL","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-6345","epss":0.00227,"percentile":0.45716,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["70.0.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.185005},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-6345","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6345","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/commit/88807c7062788254f654ea8c03427adc859321f0","https://huntr.com/bounties/d6362117-ad57-4e83-951f-b8141c6e7ca5","https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/commit/88807c7062788254f654ea8c03427adc859321f0","https://huntr.com/bounties/d6362117-ad57-4e83-951f-b8141c6e7ca5"],"description":"A vulnerability in the package_index module of pypa/setuptools versions up to 69.1.1 allows for remote code execution via its download functions.

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer.

SSLSocket.)","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-40217","epss":0.00284,"percentile":0.51662,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.8.18","3.9.18","3.10.13","3.11.5"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.14626},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.8.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-40217","versionConstraint":"<

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26636,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.4.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer

issue was discovered in Python before 3.11.1. An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-45061","epss":0.0008,"percentile":0.24661,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.7.16","3.8.16","3.9.16","3.10.9","3.11.1","3.12.0a3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.060000000000000005},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.8.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-45061","versionConstraint":"<

The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but\nOpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference that results in OpenSSL crashing.

Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45803","epss":0.00062,"percentile":0.19668,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"1.25.8"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=0,<1.26.18 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.26.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"26bbe87e6e558d9d","name":"urllib3","version":"1.25.8","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/urllib3-1.25.8.egg-info/PKG-INFO","accessPath":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/urllib3-1.25.8.egg-info/PKG-INFO","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/urllib3-1.25.8.egg-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/urllib3-1.25.8.egg-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:urllib3:1.25.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/urllib3@1.25.8","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2013-0340","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2013-0340","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/22/3","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Oct/61","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Oct/62","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Oct/63","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/33","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/34","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/35","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/38","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/39","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/40","http://securitytracker.com/id?1028213","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/04/12/6","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/10/07/4","http://www.osvdb.org/90634","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/58233","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r41eca5f4f09e74436cbb05dec450fc2bef37b5d3e966aa7cc5fada6d%40%3Cannounce.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rfb2c193360436e230b85547e85a41bea0916916f96c501f5b6fc4702%40%3Cusers.openoffice.apache.org%3E","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201701-21","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212804","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212805","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212807","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212814","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212815","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212819","http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/22/3","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Oct/61","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Oct/62","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Oct/63","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/33","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/34","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/35","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/38","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/39","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/40","http://securitytracker.com/id?1028213","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/04/12/6","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/10/07/4","http://www.osvdb.org/90634","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/58233","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r41eca5f4f09e74436cbb05dec450fc2bef37b5d3e966aa7cc5fada6d%40%3Cannounce.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rfb2c193360436e230b85547e85a41bea0916916f96c501f5b6fc4702%40%3Cusers.openoffice.apache.org%3E","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201701-21","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212804","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212805","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212807","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212814","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212815","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212819"],"description":"expat 2.1.0 and earlier does not properly handle entities expansion unless an application developer uses the XML_SetEntityDeclHandler function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption), send HTTP requests to intranet servers, or read arbitrary files via a crafted XML document, aka an XML External Entity (XXE) issue.

For example, a chain of redirects from a.com/, to b.com/1, and finally to b.com/2 would incorrectly send the Authorization header to b.com/2.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45336","epss":0.00035,"percentile":0.08892,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.22.11","1.23.5","1.24.0-rc.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.019424999999999998},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.22.9:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.22.9"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-45336","versionConstraint":"< 1.22.11,>= 1.23.0-0, < 1.23.5,>= 1.24.0-0, < 1.24.0-rc.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.22.11"}}],"artifact":{"id":"0d54afec43a90c02","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.22.9","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/etcdctl","accessPath":"/etcdctl","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.22.9:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.22.9","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.22.9","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-mh63-6h87-95cp","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mh63-6h87-95cp","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"jwt-go allows excessive memory allocation during header parsing","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-30204","epss":0.00025,"percentile":0.05382,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["4.5.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.01875},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-30204","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30204","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/commit/0951d184286dece21f73c85673fd308786ffe9c3","https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/commit/bf316c48137a1212f8d0af9288cc9ce8e59f1afb","https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/security/advisories/GHSA-mh63-6h87-95cp","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250404-0002/"],"description":"golang-jwt is a Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens.

The Python multiprocessing library, when used with the forkserver start method on Linux, allows pickles to be deserialized from any user in the same machine local network namespace, which in many system configurations means any user on the same machine. Pickles can execute arbitrary code. Thus, this allows for local user privilege escalation to the user that any forkserver process is running as. Setting multiprocessing.util.abstract_sockets_supported to False is a workaround. The forkserver start method for multiprocessing is not the default start method. This issue is Linux specific because only Linux supports abstract namespace sockets. CPython before 3.9 does not make use of Linux abstract namespace sockets by default. Support for users manually specifying an abstract namespace socket was added as a bugfix in 3.7.8 and 3.8.3, but users would need to make specific uncommon API calls in order to do that in CPython before 3.9.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-42919","epss":0.00022,"percentile":0.04338,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.9.16","3.10.9"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.01683},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.8.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-42919","versionConstraint":">= 3.10.0, < 3.10.9,>= 3.7.3, <= 3.7.15,>= 3.8.3, <= 3.8.15,>= 3.9.0, < 3.9.16 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.9.16"}}],"artifact":{"id":"d92d9485290a9158","name":"python","version":"3.8.10","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/python3.8","accessPath":"/usr/bin/python3.8","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:3.8.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.8.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@3.8.10","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-22871","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22871","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/652998","https://go.dev/issue/71988","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Y2uBTVKjBQk","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3563","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/04/04/4"],"description":"The net/http package improperly accepts a bare LF as a line terminator in chunked data chunk-size lines.

When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not user the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigations.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37891","epss":0.00033,"percentile":0.08074,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"1.25.8"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.26.19 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.26.19"}}],"artifact":{"id":"26bbe87e6e558d9d","name":"urllib3","version":"1.25.8","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/urllib3-1.25.8.egg-info/PKG-INFO","accessPath":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/urllib3-1.25.8.egg-info/PKG-INFO","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/urllib3-1.25.8.egg-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/urllib3-1.25.8.egg-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:urllib3:1.25.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/urllib3@1.25.8","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-45341","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45341","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/643099","https://go.dev/issue/71156","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/CAWXhan3Jww/m/bk9LAa-lCgAJ","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/bG8cv1muIBM/m/G461hA6lCgAJ","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3373","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250221-0004/"],"description":"A certificate with a URI which has a IPv6 address with a zone ID may incorrectly satisfy a URI name constraint that applies to the certificate chain.

Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens. A fix has been back-ported with the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch.

Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens. A fix has been back-ported with the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in \"dangerous\" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience).
