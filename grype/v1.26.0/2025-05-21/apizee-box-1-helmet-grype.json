This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which fixes a similar bug in later versions of tar.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32804","epss":0.87712,"percentile":0.99436,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"2.2.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<3.2.2 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3jfq-g458-7qm9"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.2.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a0022407fcc94586","name":"tar","version":"2.2.1","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:2.2.1:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@2.2.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-27983","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27983","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16","https://hackerone.com/reports/2319584","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JDECX4BYZLMM4S4LALN4DPZ2HUTTPLKE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YDVFUH7ACZPYB3BS4SVILNOY7NQU73VW/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240510-0002/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16","https://hackerone.com/reports/2319584","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JDECX4BYZLMM4S4LALN4DPZ2HUTTPLKE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YDVFUH7ACZPYB3BS4SVILNOY7NQU73VW/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240510-0002/"],"description":"An attacker can make the Node.js HTTP/2 server completely unavailable by sending a small amount of HTTP/2 frames packets with a few HTTP/2 frames inside.

is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th generation). Note: The impact from this issue is similar to CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2015-3193. OpenSSL version 1.0.2-1.0.2m and 1.1.0-1.1.0g are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time. The fix will be included in OpenSSL 1.1.0h when it becomes available.

an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL_shutdown() twice (once to send a close_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable \"non-stitched\" ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway).

npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-37713","epss":0.00938,"percentile":0.75192,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"2.2.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<4.4.18

Version 6.2.1 fixes this issue by preventing extraction in excessively deep sub-folders.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-28863","epss":0.00205,"percentile":0.43282,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"2.2.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<6.2.1 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-f5x3-32g6-xq36"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.2.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a0022407fcc94586","name":"tar","version":"2.2.1","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:2.2.1:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@2.2.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-6vrv-94jv-crrg","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6vrv-94jv-crrg","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"Context isolation bypass via Promise in Electron","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-15096","epss":0.00237,"percentile":0.47025,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.1.11"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.11613000000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2020-15096","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15096","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-6vrv-94jv-crrg","https://www.electronjs.org/releases/stable?page=3#release-notes-for-v824","https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-6vrv-94jv-crrg","https://www.electronjs.org/releases/stable?page=3#release-notes-for-v824"],"description":"In Electron before versions 6.1.1, 7.2.4, 8.2.4, and 9.0.0-beta21, there is a context isolation bypass, meaning that code running in the main world context in the renderer can reach into the isolated Electron context and perform privileged actions.

All other users should upgrade to 8.0.0.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45296","epss":0.00118,"percentile":0.31885,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"path-to-regexp","version":"0.1.7"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.1.10 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.1.10"}}],"artifact":{"id":"8faa4497b5e6784d","name":"path-to-regexp","version":"0.1.7","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/box1helmet-nodes/node_modules/path-to-regexp/package.json","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/box1helmet-nodes/node_modules/path-to-regexp/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:path-to-regexp:path-to-regexp:0.1.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:path-to-regexp:path_to_regexp:0.1.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:path_to_regexp:path-to-regexp:0.1.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:path_to_regexp:path_to_regexp:0.1.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:component:path-to-regexp:0.1.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:component:path_to_regexp:0.1.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:path-to:path-to-regexp:0.1.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:path-to:path_to_regexp:0.1.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:path_to:path-to-regexp:0.1.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:path_to:path_to_regexp:0.1.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:path:path-to-regexp:0.1.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:path:path_to_regexp:0.1.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/path-to-regexp@0.1.7","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2017-15896","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15896","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/december-2017-security-releases/","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/december-2017-security-releases/"],"description":"Node.js was affected by OpenSSL vulnerability CVE-2017-3737 in regards to the use of SSL_read() due to TLS handshake failure.

A vulnerability in versions prior to 18.0.0-beta.6, 17.2.0, 16.2.6, and 15.5.5 allows a renderer with JS execution to obtain access to a new renderer process with `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` enabled which in turn allows effective access to `ipcRenderer`. The `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` option does not implicitly grant Node.js access. Rather, it depends on the existing sandbox setting. If an application is sandboxed, then `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` just gives access to the sandboxed renderer APIs, which include `ipcRenderer`. If the application then additionally exposes IPC messages without IPC `senderFrame` validation that perform privileged actions or return confidential data this access to `ipcRenderer` can in turn compromise your application / user even with the sandbox enabled.
