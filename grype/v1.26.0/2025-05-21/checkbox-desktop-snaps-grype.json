This affects Python (CPython) through 3.7.12, 3.8.x through 3.8.12, 3.9.x through 3.9.10, and 3.10.x through 3.10.2.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-26488","epss":0.0089,"percentile":0.74487,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.7.13","3.8.13","3.9.11","3.10.3","3.11.0b1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.5874},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.6.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.9"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-26488","versionConstraint":"< 3.7.13,>= 3.10.0a0, < 3.10.3,>= 3.11.0a0, < 3.11.0b1,>= 3.8.0a0, < 3.8.13,>= 3.9.0a0, < 3.9.11 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.7.13"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ca444138f2460464","name":"python","version":"3.6.9","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/python3.6","accessPath":"/usr/bin/python3.6","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:3.6.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.6.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@3.6.9","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-0938","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-0938","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/526617ed68cde460236c973e5d0a8bad4de896ba","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/90e526ae67b172ed7c6c56e7edad36263b0f9403","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/a7084f6075c9595ba60119ce8c62f1496f50c568","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/b8b4b713c5f8ec0958c7ef8d29d6711889bc94ab","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/d89a5f6a6e65511a5f6e0618c4c30a7aa5aba56a","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/ff4e5c25666f63544071a6b075ae8b25c98b7a32","https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105704","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/129418","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/K4EUG6EKV6JYFIC24BASYOZS4M5XOQIB/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250314-0002/"],"description":"The Python standard library functions `urllib.parse.urlsplit` and `urlparse` accepted domain names that included square brackets which isn't valid according to RFC 3986.

An attack may be the same as in CVE-2019-11340; however, this CVE applies to Python more generally.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-16056","epss":0.00625,"percentile":0.69199,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":""},"advisories":[],"risk":0.42968750000000006},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.6.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.9"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-16056","versionConstraint":"<= 2.7.16,>= 3.0.0, <= 3.0.1,>= 3.1.0, <= 3.1.5,>= 3.2.0, <= 3.2.6,>= 3.3.0, <= 3.3.7,>= 3.4.0, <= 3.4.10,>= 3.5.0, <= 3.5.7,>= 3.6.0, <= 3.6.9,>= 3.7.0, <= 3.7.4 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}}],"artifact":{"id":"ca444138f2460464","name":"python","version":"3.6.9","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/python3.6","accessPath":"/usr/bin/python3.6","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:3.6.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.6.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@3.6.9","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-24787","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24787","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/08/3","https://go.dev/cl/583815","https://go.dev/issue/67119","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/wkkO4P9stm0","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2825","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240531-0006/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/08/3","https://go.dev/cl/583815","https://go.dev/issue/67119","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/wkkO4P9stm0","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2825","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240531-0006/"],"description":"On Darwin, building a Go module which contains CGO can trigger arbitrary code execution when using the Apple version of ld, due to usage of the -lto_library flag in a \"#cgo LDFLAGS\" directive.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.4,"exploitabilityScore":0.5,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-24787","epss":0.00714,"percentile":0.71301,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.21.10","1.22.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.40698},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.17.6:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.17.6"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-24787","versionConstraint":"< 1.21.10,>= 1.22.0-0, < 1.22.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.21.10"}}],"artifact":{"id":"3647b749920df9fd","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.17.6","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/etrace","accessPath":"/bin/etrace","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.17.6:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.17.6","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.17.6","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-mvg9-xffr-p774","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mvg9-xffr-p774","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Out of bounds read in Pillow","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-25291","epss":0.00539,"percentile":0.66607,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["8.2.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.40425},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2021-25291","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-25291","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/releasenotes/8.1.1.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-33","https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/releasenotes/8.1.1.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-33"],"description":"An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.1.1.

Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21.

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer.

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26636,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20210405180319-a5a99cb37ef4"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.17.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ec5b533ee00f7857","name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20210405180319-a5a99cb37ef4","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/etrace","accessPath":"/bin/etrace","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:networking:v0.0.0-20210405180319-a5a99cb37ef4:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/net@v0.0.0-20210405180319-a5a99cb37ef4","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.17.6","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:4nGaVu0QrbjT/AK2PRLuQfQuh6DJve+pELhqTdAj3x0=","mainModule":"github.com/anonymouse64/etrace"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-41722","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41722","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/468123","https://go.dev/issue/57274","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1568","https://go.dev/cl/468123","https://go.dev/issue/57274","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1568"],"description":"A path traversal vulnerability exists in filepath.Clean on Windows.

issue was discovered in Python before 3.11.1. An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302.

form parsing can consume large amounts of CPU and memory when processing form inputs containing very large numbers of parts. This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts.

Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41725","epss":0.00051,"percentile":0.15977,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.6"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.038250000000000006},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.17.6:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.17.6"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-41725","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.6,= 1.20.0,= 1.20.0-rc1,= 1.20.0-rc2,= 1.20.0-rc3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.6"}}],"artifact":{"id":"3647b749920df9fd","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.17.6","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/etrace","accessPath":"/bin/etrace","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.17.6:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.17.6","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.17.6","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-29400","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29400","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/491617","https://go.dev/issue/59722","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/MEb0UyuSMsU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1753","https://go.dev/cl/491617","https://go.dev/issue/59722","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/MEb0UyuSMsU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1753","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241213-0005/"],"description":"Templates containing actions in unquoted HTML attributes (e.g. \"attr={{.}}\") executed with empty input can result in output with unexpected results when parsed due to HTML normalization rules.

The os.DirFS function and http.Dir type provide access to a tree of files rooted at a given directory. These functions permit access to Windows device files under that root. For example, os.DirFS(\"C:/tmp\").Open(\"COM1\") opens the COM1 device. Both os.DirFS and http.Dir only provide read-only filesystem access. In addition, on Windows, an os.DirFS for the directory (the root of the current drive) can permit a maliciously crafted path to escape from the drive and access any path on the system. With fix applied, the behavior of os.DirFS(\"\") has changed. Previously, an empty root was treated equivalently to \"/\", so os.DirFS(\"\").Open(\"tmp\") would open the path \"/tmp\".
