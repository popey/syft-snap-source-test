X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but\nthe public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type\nof the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by\nthe OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an\nASN1_STRING.\n\nWhen CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the\nX509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass\narbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or\nenact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to\nprovide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a\nvalid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other\ninput must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which\nis uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect\napplications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs\nover a network.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-0286","epss":0.8576,"percentile":0.99335,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"cryptography","version":"39.0.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=0.8.1,<39.0.1 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-x4qr-2fvf-3mr5"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"39.0.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ab1b24a3570b6560","name":"cryptography","version":"39.0.0","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cryptography-39.0.0.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cryptography-39.0.0.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cryptography-39.0.0.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cryptography-39.0.0.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cryptography-39.0.0.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cryptography-39.0.0.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["(Apache-2.0 OR BSD-3-Clause) AND PSF-2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:cryptography.io:cryptography:39.0.0:*:*:*:*:python:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cryptography.io:cryptography:39.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/cryptography@39.0.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2007-4559","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-4559","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-August/074290.html","http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-August/074292.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/26623","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/3022","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=263261","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CVBB7NU3YIRRDOKLYVN647WPRR3IAKR6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FI55PGL47ES3OU2FQPGEHOI2EK3S2OBH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KA4Z44ZAI4SY7THCFBUDNT5EEFO4XQ3A/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-06","http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-August/074290.html","http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-August/074292.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/26623","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/3022","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=263261","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CVBB7NU3YIRRDOKLYVN647WPRR3IAKR6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FI55PGL47ES3OU2FQPGEHOI2EK3S2OBH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KA4Z44ZAI4SY7THCFBUDNT5EEFO4XQ3A/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CVBB7NU3YIRRDOKLYVN647WPRR3IAKR6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FI55PGL47ES3OU2FQPGEHOI2EK3S2OBH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KA4Z44ZAI4SY7THCFBUDNT5EEFO4XQ3A/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-06"],"description":"Directory traversal vulnerability in the (1) extract and (2) extractall functions in the tarfile module in Python allows user-assisted remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via a ..

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

is a HTTP library. Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

This vulnerability emerges during the repair operation, where the \"msiexec.exe\" process, running under the NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM context, attempts to read the %USERPROFILE% environment variable from the current user's registry.\n\nThe issue arises when the path referenced by the %USERPROFILE% environment variable does not exist. In such cases, the \"msiexec.exe\" process attempts to create the specified path in an unsafe manner, potentially leading to the creation of arbitrary folders in arbitrary locations.\n\nThe severity of this vulnerability is heightened by the fact that the %USERPROFILE% environment variable in the Windows registry can be modified by standard (or \"non-privileged\") users. Consequently, unprivileged actors, including malicious entities or trojans, can manipulate the environment variable key to deceive the privileged \"msiexec.exe\" process. This manipulation can result in the creation of folders in unintended and potentially malicious locations.\n\nIt is important to note that this vulnerability is specific to Windows users who install Node.js using the .msi installer. Users who opt for other installation methods are not affected by this particular issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-30585","epss":0.0108,"percentile":0.76822,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["16.20.1","18.16.1","20.3.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.8099999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:16.15.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"16.15.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-30585","versionConstraint":">=

(Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24816","epss":0.00417,"percentile":0.60945,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"ipython","version":"8.9.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<8.10.0 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-29gw-9793-fvw7"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"8.10.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"f78db9621297bd98","name":"ipython","version":"8.9.0","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ipython-8.9.0.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ipython-8.9.0.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ipython-8.9.0.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ipython-8.9.0.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ipython-8.9.0.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ipython-8.9.0.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:ipython_development_team_project:python-ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython_development_team_project:python_ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython_development_teamproject:python-ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython_development_teamproject:python_ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython_development_team_project:ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython_development_team:python-ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython_development_team:python_ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython_development_teamproject:ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython_dev_project:python-ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython_dev_project:python_ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython_devproject:python-ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython_devproject:python_ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython_development_team:ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-ipython:python-ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-ipython:python_ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_ipython:python-ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_ipython:python_ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython_dev_project:ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython-dev:python-ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython-dev:python_ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython_dev:python-ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython_dev:python_ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython_devproject:ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython:python-ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython:python_ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-ipython:ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_ipython:ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python-ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python_ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython-dev:ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython_dev:ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipython:ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:ipython:8.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/ipython@8.9.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-40217","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40217","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00022.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00017.html","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce%40python.org/thread/PEPLII27KYHLF4AK3ZQGKYNCRERG4YXY/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0014/","https://www.python.org/dev/security/","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00022.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00017.html","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce%40python.org/thread/PEPLII27KYHLF4AK3ZQGKYNCRERG4YXY/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0014/","https://www.python.org/dev/security/"],"description":"An issue was discovered in Python before 3.8.18, 3.9.x before 3.9.18, 3.10.x before 3.10.13, and 3.11.x before 3.11.5. It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data.

issue was discovered in Python before 3.11.1. An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and

Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this issue.

3.9.x before 3.9.16 and 3.10.x before 3.10.9 on Linux allows local privilege escalation in a non-default configuration. The Python multiprocessing library, when used with the forkserver start method on Linux, allows pickles to be deserialized from any user in the same machine local network namespace, which in many system configurations means any user on the same machine. Pickles can execute arbitrary code. Thus, this allows for local user privilege escalation to the user that any forkserver process is running as. Setting multiprocessing.util.abstract_sockets_supported to False is a workaround. The forkserver start method for multiprocessing is not the default start method. This issue is Linux specific because only Linux supports abstract namespace sockets. CPython before 3.9 does not make use of Linux abstract namespace sockets by default. Support for users manually specifying an abstract namespace socket was added as a bugfix in 3.7.8 and 3.8.3, but users would need to make specific uncommon API calls in order to do that in CPython before 3.9.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-42919","epss":0.00022,"percentile":0.04338,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.9.16","3.10.9"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.01683},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.8.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-42919","versionConstraint":">= 3.10.0, < 3.10.9,>= 3.7.3, <= 3.7.15,>= 3.8.3, <= 3.8.15,>= 3.9.0, < 3.9.16 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.9.16"}}],"artifact":{"id":"26297d0448668fce","name":"python","version":"3.8.10","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.8.so.1.0","accessPath":"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.8.so.1.0","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:3.8.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.8.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@3.8.10","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"urllib3's Proxy-Authorization request header isn't stripped during cross-origin redirects","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37891","epss":0.00033,"percentile":0.08074,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.26.19"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.01551},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-37891","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37891","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/accff72ecc2f6cf5a76d9570198a93ac7c90270e","https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/security/advisories/GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf","https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/accff72ecc2f6cf5a76d9570198a93ac7c90270e","https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/security/advisories/GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240822-0003/","https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/proxy-authorization-header-handling-vulnerability-in-urllib3-cve-2024-37891"],"description":"urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3.
