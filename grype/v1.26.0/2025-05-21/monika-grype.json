NPM package `micromatch` prior to 4.0.8 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persists. This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to greedy matching. This issue was fixed in version 4.0.8.","cvss":[{"source":"596c5446-0ce5-4ba2-aa66-48b3b757a647","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4067","epss":0.00266,"percentile":0.50079,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"micromatch","version":"4.0.4"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<4.0.8

is tool design to bundle Node.js projects into an executables. Any native code packages built by `pkg` are written to a hardcoded directory. On unix systems, this is `/tmp/pkg/*` which is a shared directory for all users on the same local system. There is no uniqueness to the package names within this directory, they are predictable. An attacker who has access to the same local system has the ability to replace the genuine executables in the shared directory with malicious executables of the same name. A user may then run the malicious executable without realising it has been modified. This package is deprecated. Therefore, there will not be a patch provided for this vulnerability. To check if your executable build by pkg depends on native code and is vulnerable, run the executable and check if `/tmp/pkg/` was created. Users should transition to actively maintained alternatives. We would recommend investigating Node.js 21’s support for single executable applications. Given the decision to deprecate the pkg package, there are no official workarounds or remediations provided by our team. Users should prioritize migrating to other packages that offer similar functionality with enhanced security.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.4,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-24828","epss":0.00079,"percentile":0.24489,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"pkg","version":"5.6.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<=5.8.1 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-22r3-9w55-cj54"}}],"artifact":{"id":"894c67ee9fc3fa6a","name":"pkg","version":"5.6.0","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/node_modules/pkg/package.json","accessPath":"/node_modules/pkg/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:vercel:pkg:5.6.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/pkg@5.6.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Express.js Open Redirect in malformed URLs","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-29041","epss":0.00081,"percentile":0.24882,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["4.19.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.044954999999999995},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-29041","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29041","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location","https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd","https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94","https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539","https://github.com/expressjs/express/security/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc","https://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800","https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location","https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd","https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94","https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539","https://github.com/expressjs/express/security/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc","https://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800"],"description":"Express.js minimalist web framework for node.
