Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":6.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cret@cert.org","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-9511","epss":0.18379,"percentile":0.94915,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.16.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":13.876145000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:f5:nginx:1.12.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"nginx","version":"1.12.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-9511","versionConstraint":">= 1.17.0, <= 1.17.2,>= 1.9.5, < 1.16.1 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:f5:nginx:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.16.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"bdd3f5d5925dcdeb","name":"nginx","version":"1.12.2","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/sbin/nginx","accessPath":"/usr/sbin/nginx","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:f5:nginx:1.12.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nginx:nginx:1.12.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/nginx@1.12.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-8q59-q68h-6hv4","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8q59-q68h-6hv4","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Critical","urls":[],"description":"Improper Input Validation in PyYAML","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-14343","epss":0.14625,"percentile":0.94145,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["5.4"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":13.747500000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2020-14343","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14343","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1860466","https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/issues/2252","https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/420","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1860466","https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/issues/2252","https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/420","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"],"description":"A vulnerability was discovered in the PyYAML library in versions before 5.4, where it is susceptible to arbitrary code execution when it processes untrusted YAML files through the full_load method or with the FullLoader loader.

Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

2.31.0.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-32681","epss":0.04731,"percentile":0.88915,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"requests","version":"2.18.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=2.3.0,<2.31.0

security regression of CVE-2019-9636 was discovered in python since commit d537ab0ff9767ef024f26246899728f0116b1ec3 affecting versions 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and from v3.8.0a4 through v3.8.0b1, which still allows an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the application.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-10160","epss":0.01722,"percentile":0.81541,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.7.17","3.5.8","3.6.9","3.7.4"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":1.4809200000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"2.7.12"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-10160","versionConstraint":">=

An attack may be the same as in CVE-2019-11340; however, this CVE applies to Python more generally.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-16056","epss":0.00625,"percentile":0.69199,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":""},"advisories":[],"risk":0.42968750000000006},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"2.7.12"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-16056","versionConstraint":"<= 2.7.16,>= 3.0.0, <= 3.0.1,>= 3.1.0, <= 3.1.5,>= 3.2.0, <= 3.2.6,>= 3.3.0, <= 3.3.7,>= 3.4.0, <= 3.4.10,>= 3.5.0, <= 3.5.7,>= 3.6.0, <= 3.6.9,>= 3.7.0, <= 3.7.4 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}}],"artifact":{"id":"74dc27ec36c075ab","name":"python","version":"2.7.12","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/python2.7","accessPath":"/usr/bin/python2.7","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython2.7.so.1.0","accessPath":"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython2.7.so.1.0","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@2.7.12","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-41741","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41741","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00031.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BPRVYA4FS34VWB4FEFYNAD7Z2LFCJVEI/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FD6M3PVVKO35WLAA7GLDBS6TEQ26SM64/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WBORRVG7VVXYOAIAD64ZHES2U2VIUKFQ/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230120-0005/","https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K81926432","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5281","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00031.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BPRVYA4FS34VWB4FEFYNAD7Z2LFCJVEI/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FD6M3PVVKO35WLAA7GLDBS6TEQ26SM64/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WBORRVG7VVXYOAIAD64ZHES2U2VIUKFQ/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230120-0005/","https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K81926432","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5281"],"description":"NGINX Open Source before versions 1.23.2 and 1.22.1, NGINX Open Source Subscription before versions R2 P1 and R1 P1, and NGINX Plus before versions R27 P1 and R26 P1 have a vulnerability in the module ngx_http_mp4_module that might allow a local attacker to corrupt NGINX worker memory, resulting in its termination or potential other impact using a specially crafted audio or video file.

According to the HTTP standard Transfer-Encoding should be a comma separated list, with the inner-most encoding first, followed by any further transfer codings, ending with chunked. Requests sent with: \"Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked\" would incorrectly get ignored, and the request would use a Content-Length header instead to determine the body size of the HTTP message.

Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory.

Prior to version 2.2.3, Werkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an unlimited number of parts, including file parts. Parts can be a small amount of bytes, but each requires CPU time to parse and may use more memory as Python data. If a request can be made to an endpoint that accesses `request.data`, `request.form`, `request.files`, or `request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)`, it can cause unexpectedly high resource usage. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out of memory kill of the process. Unlimited file parts can use up memory and file handles. If many concurrent requests are sent continuously, this can exhaust or kill all available workers.

Waitress through version 1.4.0, if a proxy server is used in front of waitress, an invalid request may be sent by an attacker that bypasses the front-end and is parsed differently by waitress leading to a potential for HTTP request smuggling. Specially crafted requests containing special whitespace characters in the Transfer-Encoding header would get parsed by Waitress as being a chunked request, but a front-end server would use the Content-Length instead as the Transfer-Encoding header is considered invalid due to containing invalid characters. If a front-end server does HTTP pipelining to a backend Waitress server this could lead to HTTP request splitting which may lead to potential cache poisoning or unexpected information disclosure.

is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When using Waitress versions 2.1.0 and prior behind a proxy that does not properly validate the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard, Waitress and the frontend proxy may disagree on where one request starts and where it ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-end proxy to waitress and later behavior. There are two classes of vulnerability that may lead to request smuggling that are addressed by this advisory: The use of Python's `int()` to parse strings into integers, leading to `+10` to be parsed as `10`, or `0x01` to be parsed as `1`, where as the standard specifies that the string should contain only digits or hex digits; and Waitress does not support chunk extensions, however it was discarding them without validating that they did not contain illegal characters. This vulnerability has been patched in Waitress 2.1.1. A workaround is available. When deploying a proxy in front of waitress, turning on any and all functionality to make sure that the request matches the RFC7230 standard. Certain proxy servers may not have this functionality though and users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of waitress instead.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-24761","epss":0.00197,"percentile":0.42344,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"waitress","version":"1.0.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<2.1.1 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4f7p-27jc-3c36"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.1.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"9de333490cb2d630","name":"waitress","version":"1.0.2","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python2.7/site-packages/waitress-1.0.2.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python2.7/site-packages/waitress-1.0.2.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python2.7/site-packages/waitress-1.0.2.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python2.7/site-packages/waitress-1.0.2.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["ZPL 2.1"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:pylons_discuss_project:python-waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:pylons_discuss_project:python_waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:pylons_discussproject:python-waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:pylons_discussproject:python_waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:pylons_discuss_project:waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-waitress:python-waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-waitress:python_waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_waitress:python-waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_waitress:python_waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:pylons-discuss:python-waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:pylons-discuss:python_waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:pylons_discuss:python-waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:pylons_discuss:python_waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:pylons_discussproject:waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:pylons_project:python-waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:pylons_project:python_waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-waitress:waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_waitress:waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:waitress:python-waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:waitress:python_waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:pylons-discuss:waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:pylons_discuss:waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:pylons_project:waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python-waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python_waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:waitress:waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:waitress:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/waitress@1.0.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-40217","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40217","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00022.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00017.html","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce%40python.org/thread/PEPLII27KYHLF4AK3ZQGKYNCRERG4YXY/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0014/","https://www.python.org/dev/security/","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00022.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00017.html","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce%40python.org/thread/PEPLII27KYHLF4AK3ZQGKYNCRERG4YXY/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0014/","https://www.python.org/dev/security/"],"description":"An issue was discovered in Python before 3.8.18, 3.9.x before 3.9.18, 3.10.x before 3.10.13, and 3.11.x before 3.11.5. It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-40217","epss":0.00284,"percentile":0.51662,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.8.18","3.9.18","3.10.13","3.11.5"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.14626},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"2.7.12"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-40217","versionConstraint":"< 3.8.18,>= 3.10.0, < 3.10.13,>= 3.11.0, < 3.11.5,>= 3.9.0, < 3.9.18 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.8.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"74dc27ec36c075ab","name":"python","version":"2.7.12","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/python2.7","accessPath":"/usr/bin/python2.7","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython2.7.so.1.0","accessPath":"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython2.7.so.1.0","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@2.7.12","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-gwvm-45gx-3cf8","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gwvm-45gx-3cf8","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Authorization Header forwarded on redirect","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2018-25091","epss":0.0025,"percentile":0.48562,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.24.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.13874999999999998},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2018-25091","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-25091","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/adb358f8e06865406d1f05e581a16cbea2136fbc","https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/compare/1.24.1...1.24.2","https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1510","https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/adb358f8e06865406d1f05e581a16cbea2136fbc","https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/compare/1.24.1...1.24.2","https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1510"],"description":"urllib3 before 1.24.2 does not remove the authorization HTTP header when following a cross-origin redirect (i.e., a redirect that differs in host, port, or scheme).

Prior to 3.1.5, An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to store a reference to a malicious string's format method, then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja, but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox.

Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302.

The `xmlattr` filter in affected versions of Jinja accepts keys containing non-attribute characters. XML/HTML attributes cannot contain spaces, `/`, `>`, or `=`, as each would then be interpreted as starting a separate attribute. If an application accepts keys (as opposed to only values) as user input, and renders these in pages that other users see as well, an attacker could use this to inject other attributes and perform XSS. The fix for CVE-2024-22195 only addressed spaces but not other characters. Accepting keys as user input is now explicitly considered an unintended use case of the `xmlattr` filter, and code that does so without otherwise validating the input should be flagged as insecure, regardless of Jinja version. Accepting _values_ as user input continues to be safe.

The debugger in affected versions of Werkzeug can allow an attacker to execute code on a developer's machine under some circumstances. This requires the attacker to get the developer to interact with a domain and subdomain they control, and enter the debugger PIN, but if they are successful it allows access to the debugger even if it is only running on localhost. This also requires the attacker to guess a URL in the developer's application that will trigger the debugger.

Affected versions were found to improperly decode certain characters. JSON strings that contain escaped surrogate characters not part of a proper surrogate pair were decoded incorrectly. Besides corrupting strings, this allowed for potential key confusion and value overwriting in dictionaries. All users parsing JSON from untrusted sources are vulnerable. From version 5.4.0, UltraJSON decodes lone surrogates in the same way as the standard library's `json` module does, preserving them in the parsed output. Users are advised to upgrade.

Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45803","epss":0.00062,"percentile":0.19668,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"1.22"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=0,<1.26.18 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.26.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"9865a7c8219901cb","name":"urllib3","version":"1.22","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python2.7/site-packages/urllib3-1.22.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python2.7/site-packages/urllib3-1.22.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python2.7/site-packages/urllib3-1.22.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python2.7/site-packages/urllib3-1.22.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:urllib3:1.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/urllib3@1.22","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-9287","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9287","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/633555735a023d3e4d92ba31da35b1205f9ecbd7","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/8450b2482586857d689b6658f08de9c8179af7db","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/9286ab3a107ea41bd3f3c3682ce2512692bdded8","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/ae961ae94bf19c8f8c7fbea3d1c25cc55ce8ae97","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/d48cc82ed25e26b02eb97c6263d95dcaa1e9111b","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/e52095a0c1005a87eed2276af7a1f2f66e2b6483","https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124651","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/124712","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/RSPJ2B5JL22FG3TKUJ7D7DQ4N5JRRBZL/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250425-0006/"],"description":"A vulnerability has been found in the CPython `venv` module and CLI where path names provided when creating a virtual environment were not quoted properly, allowing the creator to inject commands into virtual environment \"activation\" scripts (ie \"source venv/bin/activate\").

Prior to 3.1.6, an oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment interacts with the |attr filter allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to use the |attr filter to get a reference to a string's plain format method, bypassing the sandbox.

When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not user the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigations.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37891","epss":0.00033,"percentile":0.08074,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"1.22"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.26.19 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.26.19"}}],"artifact":{"id":"9865a7c8219901cb","name":"urllib3","version":"1.22","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python2.7/site-packages/urllib3-1.22.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python2.7/site-packages/urllib3-1.22.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python2.7/site-packages/urllib3-1.22.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python2.7/site-packages/urllib3-1.22.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:urllib3:1.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/urllib3@1.22","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-4030","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-4030","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/35c799d79177b962ddace2fa068101465570a29a","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/5130731c9e779b97d00a24f54cdce73ce9975dfd","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/66f8bb76a15e64a1bb7688b177ed29e26230fdee","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/6d0850c4c8188035643586ab4d8ec2468abd699e","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/81939dad77001556c527485d31a2d0f4a759033e","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/8ed546679524140d8282175411fd141fe7df070d","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/91e3669e01245185569d09e9e6e11641282971ee","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/94591dca510c796c7d40e9b4167ea56f2fdf28ca","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/c8f868dc52f98011d0f9b459b6487920bfb0ac4d","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/d86b49411753bf2c83291e3a14ae43fefded2f84","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/e1dfa978b1ad210d551385ad8073ec6154f53763","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/eb29e2f5905da93333d1ce78bc98b151e763ff46","https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/118486","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/PRGS5OR3N3PNPT4BMV2VAGN5GMUI5636/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240705-0005/","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/35c799d79177b962ddace2fa068101465570a29a","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/5130731c9e779b97d00a24f54cdce73ce9975dfd","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/66f8bb76a15e64a1bb7688b177ed29e26230fdee","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/6d0850c4c8188035643586ab4d8ec2468abd699e","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/81939dad77001556c527485d31a2d0f4a759033e","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/8ed546679524140d8282175411fd141fe7df070d","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/91e3669e01245185569d09e9e6e11641282971ee","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/94591dca510c796c7d40e9b4167ea56f2fdf28ca","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/c8f868dc52f98011d0f9b459b6487920bfb0ac4d","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/d86b49411753bf2c83291e3a14ae43fefded2f84","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/e1dfa978b1ad210d551385ad8073ec6154f53763","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/eb29e2f5905da93333d1ce78bc98b151e763ff46","https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/118486","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/PRGS5OR3N3PNPT4BMV2VAGN5GMUI5636/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240705-0005/"],"description":"On Windows a directory returned by tempfile.mkdtemp() would not always have permissions set to restrict reading and writing to the temporary directory by other users, instead usually inheriting the correct permissions from the default location.
