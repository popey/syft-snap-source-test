OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT\nIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching\nalgorithms.\n\nSuch OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure\nAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify\nwhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or\ndecrypt, or digest passed data.\n\nApplications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are\naffected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose\nof display, the severity is considered low.\n\nIn OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,\nCMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m).

In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they\nbecome available.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","epss":0.01179,"percentile":0.77782,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.0.2zk","1.1.1za","3.0.15","3.1.7","3.2.3","3.3.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":1.0669950000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.0.2s:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.0.2s"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-5535","versionConstraint":">= 1.0.2, < 1.0.2zk,>= 1.1.1, < 1.1.1za,>= 3.0.0, < 3.0.15,>= 3.1.0, < 3.1.7,>= 3.2.0, < 3.2.3,>= 3.3.0, < 3.3.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.0.2zk"}}],"artifact":{"id":"45a330c62a0339fb","name":"openssl","version":"1.0.2s","type":"nix","locations":[{"path":"/nix/store/nsrad6m4l667qpnfd85i69cn58csp762-openssl-1.0.2s","accessPath":"/nix/store/nsrad6m4l667qpnfd85i69cn58csp762-openssl-1.0.2s","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.0.2s:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:nix/openssl@1.0.2s?outputhash=nsrad6m4l667qpnfd85i69cn58csp762","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2019-17498","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17498","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-11/msg00026.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/172835/libssh2-1.9.0-Out-Of-Bounds-Read.html","https://blog.semmle.com/libssh2-integer-overflow-CVE-2019-17498/","https://github.com/kevinbackhouse/SecurityExploits/tree/8cbdbbe6363510f7d9ceec685373da12e6fc752d/libssh2/out_of_bounds_read_disconnect_CVE-2019-17498","https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2/blob/42d37aa63129a1b2644bf6495198923534322d64/src/packet.c#L480","https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2/commit/dedcbd106f8e52d5586b0205bc7677e4c9868f9c","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/11/msg00010.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/12/msg00013.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00006.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/22H4Q5XMGS3QNSA7OCL3U7UQZ4NXMR5O/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TY7EEE34RFKCTXTMBQQWWSLXZWSCXNDB/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220909-0004/","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-11/msg00026.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/172835/libssh2-1.9.0-Out-Of-Bounds-Read.html","https://blog.semmle.com/libssh2-integer-overflow-CVE-2019-17498/","https://github.com/kevinbackhouse/SecurityExploits/tree/8cbdbbe6363510f7d9ceec685373da12e6fc752d/libssh2/out_of_bounds_read_disconnect_CVE-2019-17498","https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2/blob/42d37aa63129a1b2644bf6495198923534322d64/src/packet.c#L480","https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2/commit/dedcbd106f8e52d5586b0205bc7677e4c9868f9c","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/11/msg00010.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/12/msg00013.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00006.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/22H4Q5XMGS3QNSA7OCL3U7UQZ4NXMR5O/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TY7EEE34RFKCTXTMBQQWWSLXZWSCXNDB/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220909-0004/"],"description":"In libssh2 v1.9.0 and earlier versions, the SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT logic in packet.c has an integer overflow in a bounds check, enabling an attacker to specify an arbitrary (out-of-bounds) offset for a subsequent memory read.

strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected

X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.

After a\nsufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master\nsecret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the\napplication data sent over that connection.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-4304","epss":0.00191,"percentile":0.41727,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.0.2zg","1.1.1t","3.0.8"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.10409500000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.0.2s:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.0.2s"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-4304","versionConstraint":">= 1.0.2, < 1.0.2zg,>= 1.1.1, < 1.1.1t,>= 3.0.0, < 3.0.8 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.0.2zg"}}],"artifact":{"id":"45a330c62a0339fb","name":"openssl","version":"1.0.2s","type":"nix","locations":[{"path":"/nix/store/nsrad6m4l667qpnfd85i69cn58csp762-openssl-1.0.2s","accessPath":"/nix/store/nsrad6m4l667qpnfd85i69cn58csp762-openssl-1.0.2s","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.0.2s:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:nix/openssl@1.0.2s?outputhash=nsrad6m4l667qpnfd85i69cn58csp762","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-23839","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23839","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Low","urls":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-637483.pdf","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=30919ab80a478f2d81f2e9acdcca3fa4740cd547","https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Security_Advisories/SA44846","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210219-0009/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20210216.txt","https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html","https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-637483.pdf","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=30919ab80a478f2d81f2e9acdcca3fa4740cd547","https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Security_Advisories/SA44846","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210219-0009/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20210216.txt","https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"],"description":"OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2s-1.0.2x).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.7,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.3,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-23839","epss":0.00289,"percentile":0.52118,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.0.2y"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.10115},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.0.2s:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.0.2s"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2021-23839","versionConstraint":">=

in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k).

has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can find a configuration file as well as certificates used for verification in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable with the --prefix / --openssldir configuration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix-like environment and the default prefix for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR should be '/usr/local'. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, find themselves looking at sub-directories of 'C:/usr/local', which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users to modify OpenSSL's default configuration, insert CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, '/usr/local/ssl' is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own --prefix. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue.
