Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45288","epss":0.64852,"percentile":0.98353,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.21.9","1.22.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":48.638999999999996},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.19.13:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.19.13"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45288","versionConstraint":"< 1.21.9,>= 1.22.0-0, < 1.22.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.21.9"}}],"artifact":{"id":"7711548e9bb10609","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.19.13","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/clockify-cli","accessPath":"/clockify-cli","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.19.13:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.19.13","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.19.13","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-24784","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24784","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/555596","https://go.dev/issue/65083","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2609","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0007/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/555596","https://go.dev/issue/65083","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2609","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0007/"],"description":"The ParseAddressList function incorrectly handles comments (text within parentheses) within display names.
