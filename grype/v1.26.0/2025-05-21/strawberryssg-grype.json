This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which fixes a similar bug in later versions of tar.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32804","epss":0.87712,"percentile":0.99436,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"4.4.10"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=4.0.0,<4.4.14 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3jfq-g458-7qm9"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"4.4.14"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a5e0bbd63acca618","name":"tar","version":"4.4.10","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/usr/share/nodejs/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/usr/share/nodejs/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:4.4.10:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@4.4.10","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2007-4559","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-4559","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-August/074290.html","http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-August/074292.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/26623","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/3022","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=263261","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CVBB7NU3YIRRDOKLYVN647WPRR3IAKR6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FI55PGL47ES3OU2FQPGEHOI2EK3S2OBH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KA4Z44ZAI4SY7THCFBUDNT5EEFO4XQ3A/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-06","http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-August/074290.html","http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-August/074292.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/26623","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/3022","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=263261","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CVBB7NU3YIRRDOKLYVN647WPRR3IAKR6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FI55PGL47ES3OU2FQPGEHOI2EK3S2OBH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KA4Z44ZAI4SY7THCFBUDNT5EEFO4XQ3A/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CVBB7NU3YIRRDOKLYVN647WPRR3IAKR6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FI55PGL47ES3OU2FQPGEHOI2EK3S2OBH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KA4Z44ZAI4SY7THCFBUDNT5EEFO4XQ3A/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-06"],"description":"Directory traversal vulnerability in the (1) extract and (2) extractall functions in the tarfile module in Python allows user-assisted remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via a ..

npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-37713","epss":0.00938,"percentile":0.75192,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"4.4.10"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<4.4.18

Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32803","epss":0.00208,"percentile":0.43714,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"4.4.10"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=4.0.0,<4.4.15

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-40217","epss":0.00284,"percentile":0.51662,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.8.18","3.9.18","3.10.13","3.11.5"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.14626},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.18:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"2.7.18"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-40217","versionConstraint":"<

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26636,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20210614182718-04defd469f4e"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.17.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"c71449f82006552c","name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20210614182718-04defd469f4e","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/strawberry-windows_windows_amd64/strawberry.exe","accessPath":"/strawberry-windows_windows_amd64/strawberry.exe","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:networking:v0.0.0-20210614182718-04defd469f4e:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/net@v0.0.0-20210614182718-04defd469f4e","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.5","architecture":"34404","h1Digest":"h1:XpT3nA5TvE525Ne3hInMh6+GETgn27Zfm9dxsThnX2Q=","mainModule":"github.com/strawberryssg/strawberry-v0"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-41722","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41722","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/468123","https://go.dev/issue/57274","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1568","https://go.dev/cl/468123","https://go.dev/issue/57274","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1568"],"description":"A path traversal vulnerability exists in filepath.Clean on Windows.

issue was discovered in Python before 3.11.1. An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-45061","epss":0.0008,"percentile":0.24661,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.7.16","3.8.16","3.9.16","3.10.9","3.11.1","3.12.0a3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.060000000000000005},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.18:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"2.7.18"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-45061","versionConstraint":"<

This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In addition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxheaders=.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24536","epss":0.00066,"percentile":0.20839,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.8","1.20.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0495},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.5:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.5"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-24536","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.8,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"fc0a090cdb8df0c8","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.5","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/strawberry-windows_windows_amd64/strawberry.exe","accessPath":"/strawberry-windows_windows_amd64/strawberry.exe","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.5:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.16.5","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.5","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-24539","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24539","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/491615","https://go.dev/issue/59720","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/MEb0UyuSMsU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1751","https://go.dev/cl/491615","https://go.dev/issue/59720","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/MEb0UyuSMsU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1751","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241129-0005/"],"description":"Angle brackets (<>) are not considered dangerous characters when inserted into CSS contexts.

This occurs because sprintf is used unsafely.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-3177","epss":0.00044,"percentile":0.12972,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.6.13","3.7.10","3.8.8","3.9.2","3.10.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.03883},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.18:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"2.7.18"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2021-3177","versionConstraint":"< 3.6.13,>= 3.10.0a0, < 3.10.0,>= 3.7.0a0, < 3.7.10,>= 3.8.0a0, < 3.8.8,>= 3.9.0a0, < 3.9.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.6.13"}}],"artifact":{"id":"495d0e6a9a600210","name":"python","version":"2.7.18","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/python2.7","accessPath":"/usr/bin/python2.7","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:2.7.18:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.18:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@2.7.18","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-41725","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41725","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/468124","https://go.dev/issue/58006","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1569","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://go.dev/cl/468124","https://go.dev/issue/58006","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1569","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09"],"description":"A denial of service is possible from excessive resource consumption in net/http and mime/multipart. Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41725","epss":0.00051,"percentile":0.15977,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.6"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.038250000000000006},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.5:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.5"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-41725","versionConstraint":"<

Versions prior to CPython 3.5 are not affected due to the vulnerable API not being included.","cvss":[{"source":"cna@python.org","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":5.1},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-3219","epss":0.00059,"percentile":0.18705,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.8.20","3.9.20","3.10.15","3.11.10","3.12.5","3.13.0rc1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.029795000000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.18:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"2.7.18"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-3219","versionConstraint":"<

npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 \"short path\" counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include a directory with one form of the path, followed by a symbolic link with a different string that resolves to the same file system entity, followed by a file using the first form. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink that had a different apparent name that resolved to the same entry in the filesystem, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. If this is not possible, a workaround is available in the referenced

npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.16, 5.0.8, and 6.1.7 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit. A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. If this is not possible, a workaround is available in the referenced GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-37701","epss":0.00016,"percentile":0.02438,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"4.4.10"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=3.0.0,<4.4.16 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"4.4.16"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a5e0bbd63acca618","name":"tar","version":"4.4.10","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/usr/share/nodejs/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/usr/share/nodejs/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:4.4.10:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@4.4.10","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-24532","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24532","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/471255","https://go.dev/issue/58647","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/3-TpUx48iQY","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1621","https://go.dev/cl/471255","https://go.dev/issue/58647","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/3-TpUx48iQY","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1621","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230331-0011/"],"description":"The ScalarMult and ScalarBaseMult methods of the P256 Curve may return an incorrect result if called with some specific unreduced scalars (a scalar larger than the order of the curve).
