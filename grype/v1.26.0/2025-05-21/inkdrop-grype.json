This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which fixes a similar bug in later versions of tar.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32804","epss":0.87712,"percentile":0.99436,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"6.1.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=6.0.0,<6.1.1 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3jfq-g458-7qm9"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.1.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"f66d4930591bc1a9","name":"tar","version":"6.1.0","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/usr/lib/inkdrop/resources/app/ipm/node_modules/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/usr/lib/inkdrop/resources/app/ipm/node_modules/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:6.1.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@6.1.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-27983","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27983","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16","https://hackerone.com/reports/2319584","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JDECX4BYZLMM4S4LALN4DPZ2HUTTPLKE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YDVFUH7ACZPYB3BS4SVILNOY7NQU73VW/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240510-0002/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16","https://hackerone.com/reports/2319584","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JDECX4BYZLMM4S4LALN4DPZ2HUTTPLKE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YDVFUH7ACZPYB3BS4SVILNOY7NQU73VW/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240510-0002/"],"description":"An attacker can make the Node.js HTTP/2 server completely unavailable by sending a small amount of HTTP/2 frames packets with a few HTTP/2 frames inside.

vulnerability has been identified in the Node.js (.msi version) installation process, specifically affecting Windows users who install Node.js using the .msi installer.

In such cases, the \"msiexec.exe\" process attempts to create the specified path in an unsafe manner, potentially leading to the creation of arbitrary folders in arbitrary locations.\n\nThe severity of this vulnerability is heightened by the fact that the %USERPROFILE% environment variable in the Windows registry can be modified by standard (or \"non-privileged\") users. Consequently, unprivileged actors, including malicious entities or trojans, can manipulate the environment variable key to deceive the privileged \"msiexec.exe\" process. This manipulation can result in the creation of folders in unintended and potentially malicious locations.\n\nIt is important to note that this vulnerability is specific to Windows users who install Node.js using the .msi installer.

This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-37713","epss":0.00938,"percentile":0.75192,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"6.1.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=6.0.0,<6.1.9

npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32803","epss":0.00208,"percentile":0.43714,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"6.1.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=6.0.0,<6.1.2 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.1.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"f66d4930591bc1a9","name":"tar","version":"6.1.0","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/usr/lib/inkdrop/resources/app/ipm/node_modules/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/usr/lib/inkdrop/resources/app/ipm/node_modules/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:6.1.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@6.1.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-22025","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22025","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://hackerone.com/reports/2284065","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00029.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240517-0008/","https://hackerone.com/reports/2284065","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00029.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240517-0008/"],"description":"A vulnerability in Node.js has been identified, allowing for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack through resource exhaustion when using the fetch() function to retrieve content from an untrusted URL.\nThe vulnerability stems from the fact that the fetch() function in Node.js always decodes Brotli, making it possible for an attacker to cause resource exhaustion when fetching content from an untrusted URL.\nAn attacker controlling the URL passed into fetch() can exploit this vulnerability to exhaust memory, potentially leading to process termination, depending on the system configuration.","cvss":[{"source":"support@hackerone.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-22025","epss":0.00239,"percentile":0.47244,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["18.19.1","20.11.1","21.6.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.137425},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:18.15.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"18.15.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-22025","versionConstraint":"< 18.19.1,>= 19, < 20.11.1,>= 21, < 21.6.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"18.19.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"c0f392636f488fb4","name":"node","version":"18.15.0","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/lib/inkdrop/resources/app/ipm/bin/node","accessPath":"/usr/lib/inkdrop/resources/app/ipm/bin/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:18.15.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/node@18.15.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-36138","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36138","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/july-2024-security-releases","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241108-0010/"],"description":"Bypass incomplete fix of CVE-2024-27980, that arises from improper handling of batch files with all possible extensions on Windows via child_process.spawn / child_process.spawnSync.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 \"short path\" counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include a directory with one form of the path, followed by a symbolic link with a different string that resolves to the same file system entity, followed by a file using the first form. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink that had a different apparent name that resolved to the same entry in the filesystem, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues.
