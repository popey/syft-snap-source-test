A request with a number of headers exceeding theserver.maxHeadersCount threshold could be used to crash a ws server. The vulnerability was fixed in ws@8.17.1 (e55e510) and backported to ws@7.5.10 (22c2876), ws@6.2.3 (eeb76d3), and ws@5.2.4 (4abd8f6). In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways: 1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the --max-http-header-size=size and/or the maxHeaderSize options so that no more headers than the server.maxHeadersCount limit can be sent. 2. Set server.maxHeadersCount to 0 so that no limit is applied.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37890","epss":0.0032,"percentile":0.54565,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"ws","version":"7.5.6"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=7.0.0,<7.5.10 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"7.5.10"}}],"artifact":{"id":"99ec3ce025c49458","name":"ws","version":"7.5.6","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/ws/package.json","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/ws/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:ws_project:ws:7.5.6:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/ws@7.5.6","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-22025","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22025","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://hackerone.com/reports/2284065","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00029.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240517-0008/","https://hackerone.com/reports/2284065","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00029.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240517-0008/"],"description":"A vulnerability in Node.js has been identified, allowing for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack through resource exhaustion when using the fetch() function to retrieve content from an untrusted URL.\nThe vulnerability stems from the fact that the fetch() function in Node.js always decodes Brotli, making it possible for an attacker to cause resource exhaustion when fetching content from an untrusted URL.\nAn attacker controlling the URL passed into fetch() can exploit this vulnerability to exhaust memory, potentially leading to process termination, depending on the system configuration.","cvss":[{"source":"support@hackerone.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-22025","epss":0.00239,"percentile":0.47244,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["18.19.1","20.11.1","21.6.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.137425},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:18.18.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"18.18.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-22025","versionConstraint":"< 18.19.1,>= 19, < 20.11.1,>= 21, < 21.6.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"18.19.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"141bf16f2f481149","name":"node","version":"18.18.2","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/node","accessPath":"/bin/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:18.18.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/node@18.18.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-36138","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36138","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/july-2024-security-releases","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241108-0010/"],"description":"Bypass incomplete fix of CVE-2024-27980, that arises from improper handling of batch files with all possible extensions on Windows via child_process.spawn / child_process.spawnSync.

When using versions of Babel prior to 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17 to compile regular expression named capturing groups, Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`). Generated code is vulnerable if all the following conditions are true: Using Babel to compile regular expression named capturing groups, using the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups, and the code using untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`. This problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17. It's likely that individual users do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees use of a new enough `@babel/helpers` version. Note that just updating Babel dependencies is not enough; one will also need to re-compile the code. No known workarounds are available.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.2,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27789","epss":0.0002,"percentile":0.03804,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"@babel/runtime","version":"7.23.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<7.26.10 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"7.26.10"}}],"artifact":{"id":"7ca67c90125c5995","name":"@babel/runtime","version":"7.23.2","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/@babel/runtime/package.json","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/@babel/runtime/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:@babel/runtime:@babel/runtime:7.23.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:babel:@babel/runtime:7.23.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/%40babel/runtime@7.23.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-23084","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23084","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/january-2025-security-releases"],"description":"A vulnerability has been identified in Node.js, specifically affecting the handling of drive names in the Windows environment.
