This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which fixes a similar bug in later versions of tar.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32804","epss":0.87712,"percentile":0.99436,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"2.2.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<3.2.2 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3jfq-g458-7qm9"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.2.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a0022407fcc94586","name":"tar","version":"2.2.1","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:2.2.1:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@2.2.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-0286","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0286","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/LibreSSL/libressl-3.6.2-relnotes.txt","https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/7.2/common/018_x509.patch.sig","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=2c6c9d439b484e1ba9830d8454a34fa4f80fdfe9","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=2f7530077e0ef79d98718138716bc51ca0cad658","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=fd2af07dc083a350c959147097003a14a5e8ac4d","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt","https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/LibreSSL/libressl-3.6.2-relnotes.txt","https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/7.2/common/018_x509.patch.sig","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=2c6c9d439b484e1ba9830d8454a34fa4f80fdfe9","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=2f7530077e0ef79d98718138716bc51ca0cad658","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=fd2af07dc083a350c959147097003a14a5e8ac4d","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt"],"description":"There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing\ninside an X.509 GeneralName.

OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT\nIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching\nalgorithms.\n\nSuch OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure\nAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify\nwhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or\ndecrypt, or digest passed data.\n\nApplications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are\naffected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose\nof display, the severity is considered low.\n\nIn OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,\nCMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way\nthat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered\nnot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,\nand the severity is therefore considered low.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-2650","epss":0.9197,"percentile":0.99687,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.0.2zh","1.1.1u","3.0.9","3.1.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":52.88274999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-2650","versionConstraint":">= 1.0.2, < 1.0.2zh,>= 1.1.1, < 1.1.1u,>= 3.0.0, < 3.0.9,>= 3.1.0, < 3.1.1 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.1u"}}],"artifact":{"id":"08ee522cf39d7fe7","name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/openssl","accessPath":"/usr/bin/openssl","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/openssl@1.1.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-27983","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27983","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16","https://hackerone.com/reports/2319584","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JDECX4BYZLMM4S4LALN4DPZ2HUTTPLKE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YDVFUH7ACZPYB3BS4SVILNOY7NQU73VW/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240510-0002/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16","https://hackerone.com/reports/2319584","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JDECX4BYZLMM4S4LALN4DPZ2HUTTPLKE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YDVFUH7ACZPYB3BS4SVILNOY7NQU73VW/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240510-0002/"],"description":"An attacker can make the Node.js HTTP/2 server completely unavailable by sending a small amount of HTTP/2 frames packets with a few HTTP/2 frames inside.

BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop.

RFC 7539 specifies that the nonce value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable nonce length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than 12 bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of up to 16 bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are significant and any additional leading bytes are ignored. It is a requirement of using this cipher that nonce values are unique. Messages encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality and integrity attacks. If an application changes the default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a change to the leading bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a new unique nonce then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messages with a reused nonce. Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are not covered by the integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application that relies on the integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long nonce may be further affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher, including in SSL/TLS, is safe because no such use sets such a long nonce value. However user applications that use this cipher directly and set a non-default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes may be vulnerable. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.1.0 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1c (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1b). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0k (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0j).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-1543","epss":0.05253,"percentile":0.89527,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":""},"advisories":[],"risk":3.7033650000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-1543","versionConstraint":">= 1.1.0, <= 1.1.0j,>= 1.1.1, <= 1.1.1b (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}}],"artifact":{"id":"08ee522cf39d7fe7","name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/openssl","accessPath":"/usr/bin/openssl","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/openssl@1.1.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-72xf-g2v4-qvf3","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-72xf-g2v4-qvf3","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"tough-cookie Prototype Pollution vulnerability","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-26136","epss":0.05191,"percentile":0.89452,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["4.1.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":2.984825},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-26136","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26136","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/commit/12d474791bb856004e858fdb1c47b7608d09cf6e","https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/issues/282","https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/releases/tag/v4.1.3","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/07/msg00010.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3HUE6ZR5SL73KHL7XUPAOEL6SB7HUDT2/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6PVVPNSAGSDS63HQ74PJ7MZ3MU5IYNVZ/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-TOUGHCOOKIE-5672873","https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/commit/12d474791bb856004e858fdb1c47b7608d09cf6e","https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/issues/282","https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/releases/tag/v4.1.3","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/07/msg00010.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3HUE6ZR5SL73KHL7XUPAOEL6SB7HUDT2/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6PVVPNSAGSDS63HQ74PJ7MZ3MU5IYNVZ/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-TOUGHCOOKIE-5672873"],"description":"Versions of the package tough-cookie before 4.1.3 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution due to improper handling of Cookies when using CookieJar in rejectPublicSuffixes=false mode.

order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the \"out\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \"outlen\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \"out\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash.

No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1e (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1d). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2u (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2t).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-1551","epss":0.03862,"percentile":0.87717,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":""},"advisories":[],"risk":1.9599650000000004},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-1551","versionConstraint":">= 1.0.2, <= 1.0.2t,>= 1.1.1, <= 1.1.1d (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}}],"artifact":{"id":"08ee522cf39d7fe7","name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/openssl","accessPath":"/usr/bin/openssl","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/openssl@1.1.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-957j-59c2-j692","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-957j-59c2-j692","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Critical","urls":[],"description":"Prototype pollution in getobject","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-28282","epss":0.01979,"percentile":0.82713,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.0.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":1.86026},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2020-28282","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28282","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://github.com/cowboy/node-getobject/blob/aba04a8e1d6180eb39eff09990c3a43886ba8937/lib/getobject.js#L48","https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2020-28282","https://github.com/cowboy/node-getobject/blob/aba04a8e1d6180eb39eff09990c3a43886ba8937/lib/getobject.js#L48","https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2020-28282"],"description":"Prototype pollution vulnerability in 'getobject' version 0.1.0 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-28282","epss":0.01979,"percentile":0.82713,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"getobject","version":"0.1.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.0.0 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-957j-59c2-j692"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.0.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"991f0138bbe60711","name":"getobject","version":"0.1.0","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/node_modules/bower/node_modules/getobject/package.json","accessPath":"/node_modules/bower/node_modules/getobject/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:getobject_project:getobject:0.1.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/getobject@0.1.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-7264","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7264","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/31/1","https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2024-7264.html","https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2024-7264.json","https://hackerone.com/reports/2629968","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/31/1","https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/27959ecce75cdb2809c0bdb3286e60e08fadb519","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240828-0008/"],"description":"libcurl's ASN1 parser code has the `GTime2str()` function, used for parsing an\nASN.1 Generalized Time field.

an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL_shutdown() twice (once to send a close_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable \"non-stitched\" ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2r (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2q).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.3,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-1559","epss":0.03173,"percentile":0.86379,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.17.0","8.15.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":1.602365},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:6.14.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"6.14.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-1559","versionConstraint":">=

summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an\nempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to\nbe sent to the peer.\n\nImpact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences\nsuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they\nbecome available.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","epss":0.01179,"percentile":0.77782,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.0.2zk","1.1.1za","3.0.15","3.1.7","3.2.3","3.3.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":1.0669950000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-5535","versionConstraint":">= 1.0.2, < 1.0.2zk,>= 1.1.1, < 1.1.1za,>= 3.0.0, < 3.0.15,>= 3.1.0, < 3.1.7,>= 3.2.0, < 3.2.3,>= 3.3.0, < 3.3.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.1za"}}],"artifact":{"id":"08ee522cf39d7fe7","name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/openssl","accessPath":"/usr/bin/openssl","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/openssl@1.1.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-jf85-cpcp-j695","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jf85-cpcp-j695","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Critical","urls":[],"description":"Prototype Pollution in lodash","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-10744","epss":0.01176,"percentile":0.77758,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["4.17.12"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":1.06428},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2019-10744","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10744","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3024","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20191004-0005/","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-LODASH-450202","https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K47105354?utm_source=f5support&amp%3Butm_medium=RSS","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3024","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20191004-0005/","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-LODASH-450202","https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K47105354?utm_source=f5support&amp%3Butm_medium=RSS","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html"],"description":"Versions of lodash lower than 4.17.12 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.

This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does.

1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator (RNG). This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not being used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state is significantly reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL_init_crypto() explicitly using OPENSSL_INIT_ATFORK then this problem does not occur at all.

strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-3712","epss":0.00844,"percentile":0.73731,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.0.2za","1.1.1l"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.5950199999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2021-3712","versionConstraint":">= 1.0.2, < 1.0.2za,>= 1.1.1, < 1.1.1l (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.1l"}}],"artifact":{"id":"08ee522cf39d7fe7","name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/openssl","accessPath":"/usr/bin/openssl","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/openssl@1.1.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-gqgv-6jq5-jjj9","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gqgv-6jq5-jjj9","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Prototype Pollution Protection Bypass in qs","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2017-1000048","epss":0.0078,"percentile":0.72648,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.0.4"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.585},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2017-1000048","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000048","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2672","https://github.com/ljharb/qs/issues/200","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2672","https://github.com/ljharb/qs/issues/200"],"description":"the web framework using ljharb's qs module older than v6.3.2, v6.2.3, v6.1.2, and v6.0.4 is vulnerable to a DoS.

summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation\ncontains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications on the\nWindows 64 platform when running on newer X86_64 processors supporting the\nAVX512-IFMA instructions.\n\nImpact summary: If in an application that uses the OpenSSL library an attacker\ncan influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application\nstate might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL does\nnot save the contents of non-volatile XMM registers on Windows 64 platform\nwhen calculating the MAC of data larger than 64 bytes. Before returning to\nthe caller all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring their\nprevious content. The vulnerable code is used only on newer x86_64 processors\nsupporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions.\n\nThe consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can\nbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not\ndepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst\nconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application\nprocess. However given the contents of the registers are just zeroized so\nthe attacker cannot put arbitrary values inside, the most likely consequence,\nif any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent\ncalculations or a crash leading to a denial of service.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the\nCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)\nalgorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol\nversions 1.2 and 1.3 and a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD\ncipher is used by the server. This implies that server applications using\nOpenSSL can be potentially impacted.

Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained\nfrom an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nThe function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those\nchecks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying to use\na very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which\nis over 10,000 bits in length.\n\nHowever the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters\nthat have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value\neven if it has already been found to be too large.\n\nAn application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained\nfrom an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThe function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.\nAn application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.\nThe other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and\nEVP_PKEY_param_check().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications\nwhen using the '-check' option.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this

Puny coded names always start with `xn--` and should not be allowed to pattern match, but the wildcard check in curl could still check for `x*`, which would match even though the IDN name most likely contained nothing even resembling an `x`.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28321","epss":0.00631,"percentile":0.69322,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["8.1.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.343895},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:haxx:curl:7.58.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"curl","version":"7.58.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-28321","versionConstraint":"< 8.1.0 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:haxx:curl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"8.1.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"1ed4694c4ce0ed8d","name":"curl","version":"7.58.0","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/curl","accessPath":"/usr/bin/curl","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:haxx:curl:7.58.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/curl@7.58.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-0466","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0466","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/28/4","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=0d16b7e99aafc0b4a6d729eec65a411a7e025f0a","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=51e8a84ce742db0f6c70510d0159dad8f7825908","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=73398dea26de9899fb4baa94098ad0a61f435c72","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=fc814a30fc4f0bc54fcea7d9a7462f5457aab061","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00011.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230414-0001/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5417","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230328.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/28/4","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=0d16b7e99aafc0b4a6d729eec65a411a7e025f0a","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=51e8a84ce742db0f6c70510d0159dad8f7825908","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=73398dea26de9899fb4baa94098ad0a61f435c72","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=fc814a30fc4f0bc54fcea7d9a7462f5457aab061","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00011.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230414-0001/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5417","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230328.txt"],"description":"The function X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() is documented to\nimplicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate\nverification.

This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack.

is an open source WebSocket client and server for Node.js. A request with a number of headers exceeding theserver.maxHeadersCount threshold could be used to crash a ws server. The vulnerability was fixed in ws@8.17.1 (e55e510) and backported to ws@7.5.10 (22c2876), ws@6.2.3 (eeb76d3), and ws@5.2.4 (4abd8f6). In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways: 1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the --max-http-header-size=size and/or the maxHeaderSize options so that no more headers than the server.maxHeadersCount limit can be sent. 2. Set server.maxHeadersCount to 0 so that no limit is applied.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37890","epss":0.0032,"percentile":0.54565,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"ws","version":"4.1.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=2.1.0,<5.2.4 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"5.2.4"}}],"artifact":{"id":"879f1030c2731c52","name":"ws","version":"4.1.0","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/node_modules/bower/node_modules/ws/package.json","accessPath":"/node_modules/bower/node_modules/ws/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:ws_project:ws:4.1.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/ws@4.1.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-v88g-cgmw-v5xw","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v88g-cgmw-v5xw","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Prototype Pollution in Ajv","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.6,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-15366","epss":0.00451,"percentile":0.62794,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.12.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.23903000000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2020-15366","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15366","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/releases/tag/v6.12.3","https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/tags","https://hackerone.com/bugs?subject=user&report_id=894259","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0007/","https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/releases/tag/v6.12.3","https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/tags","https://hackerone.com/bugs?subject=user&report_id=894259","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0007/"],"description":"An issue was discovered in ajv.validate() in Ajv (aka Another JSON Schema Validator) 6.12.2.

summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted\nexplicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads\nor writes.\n\nImpact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or\neven a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols\ninvolving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only \"named\ncurves\" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they\nspecify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent\nproblematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable\napplication is low.\n\nIn particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,\nso problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509\ncertificates.  Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an \"exotic\"\ncurve encoding.\n\nThe affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(),\nand various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.\n\nApplications working with \"exotic\" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,\nthat make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero\nconstant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a\nresult of reading or writing outside of array bounds.  Remote code execution\ncannot easily be ruled out.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.3,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-9143","epss":0.00416,"percentile":0.60915,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.0.2zl","1.1.1zb","3.0.16","3.1.8","3.2.4","3.3.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.19343999999999997},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-9143","versionConstraint":">= 1.0.2, < 1.0.2zl,>= 1.1.1, < 1.1.1zb,>= 3.0.0, < 3.0.16,>= 3.1.0, < 3.1.8,>= 3.2.0, < 3.2.4,>= 3.3.0, < 3.3.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.1zb"}}],"artifact":{"id":"08ee522cf39d7fe7","name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/openssl","accessPath":"/usr/bin/openssl","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/openssl@1.1.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-62gr-4qp9-h98f","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-62gr-4qp9-h98f","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Regular Expression Denial of Service in Handlebars","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-20922","epss":0.0025,"percentile":0.4844,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["4.4.5"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.1875},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2019-20922","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-20922","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/commit/8d5530ee2c3ea9f0aee3fde310b9f36887d00b8b","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-HANDLEBARS-480388","https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1300","https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/commit/8d5530ee2c3ea9f0aee3fde310b9f36887d00b8b","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-HANDLEBARS-480388","https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1300"],"description":"Handlebars before 4.4.5 allows Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) because of eager matching.

Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained\nfrom an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nThe function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing\nCVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger\nan overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value,\nif present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is\nunnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.\n\nAn application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained\nfrom an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThe function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.\nAn application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.\nThe other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and\nEVP_PKEY_param_check().\n\nAlso vulnerable are

X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the\nSMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by\nend user applications.\n\nThe function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter\nBIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of\nthe BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS\nrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function\nreturns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain\nis not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains\ninternal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on\nto call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most\nlikely result in a crash.\n\n\n\nThis scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which\nmay cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on\nthe BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions\nPEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream,\nSMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7.\n\nOther public API functions that may be impacted by this include\ni2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and\ni2d_PKCS7_bio_stream.\n\nThe OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-0215","epss":0.00167,"percentile":0.38921,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.0.2zg","1.1.1t","3.0.8"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.12525000000000003},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-0215","versionConstraint":">= 1.0.2, < 1.0.2zg,>= 1.1.1, < 1.1.1t,>= 3.0.0, < 3.0.8 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.1t"}}],"artifact":{"id":"08ee522cf39d7fe7","name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/openssl","accessPath":"/usr/bin/openssl","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/openssl@1.1.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-28322","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28322","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Low","urls":["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/47","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/48","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/52","https://hackerone.com/reports/1954658","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/12/msg00015.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F4I75RDGX5ULSSCBE5BF3P5I5SFO7ULQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z2LIWHWKOVH24COGGBCVOWDXXIUPKOMK/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-12","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230609-0009/","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213843","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213844","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213845","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/47","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/48","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/52","https://hackerone.com/reports/1954658","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/12/msg00015.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F4I75RDGX5ULSSCBE5BF3P5I5SFO7ULQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z2LIWHWKOVH24COGGBCVOWDXXIUPKOMK/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-12","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230609-0009/","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213843","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213844","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213845"],"description":"An information disclosure vulnerability exists in curl <v8.1.0 when doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the same handle previously wasused to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback.

Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and 3.0.1 on the 15th of December 2021. For the 1.0.2 release it is addressed in git commit 6fc1aaaf3 that is available to premium support customers only. It will be made available in 1.0.2zc when it is released. The issue only affects OpenSSL on MIPS platforms. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.1 (Affected 3.0.0). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1m (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1l). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zc-dev (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zb).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.3,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-4160","epss":0.00225,"percentile":0.45573,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.1.1m"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.11362499999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2021-4160","versionConstraint":">= 1.0.2, <= 1.0.2zb,>= 1.1.1, < 1.1.1m,= 3.0.0,= 3.0.0-alpha1,= 3.0.0-alpha10,= 3.0.0-alpha11,= 3.0.0-alpha12,= 3.0.0-alpha13,= 3.0.0-alpha14,= 3.0.0-alpha15,= 3.0.0-alpha16,= 3.0.0-alpha17,= 3.0.0-alpha2,= 3.0.0-alpha3,= 3.0.0-alpha4,= 3.0.0-alpha5,= 3.0.0-alpha6,= 3.0.0-alpha7,= 3.0.0-alpha8,= 3.0.0-alpha9,= 3.0.0-beta1,= 3.0.0-beta2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.1m"}}],"artifact":{"id":"08ee522cf39d7fe7","name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/openssl","accessPath":"/usr/bin/openssl","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/openssl@1.1.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-qqgx-2p2h-9c37","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qqgx-2p2h-9c37","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"ini before 1.3.6 vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via ini.parse","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":7.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-7788","epss":0.00153,"percentile":0.3726,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.3.6"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.11321999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2020-7788","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7788","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://github.com/npm/ini/commit/56d2805e07ccd94e2ba0984ac9240ff02d44b6f1","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/12/msg00032.html","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-INI-1048974","https://github.com/npm/ini/commit/56d2805e07ccd94e2ba0984ac9240ff02d44b6f1","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/12/msg00032.html","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-INI-1048974"],"description":"This affects the package ini before 1.3.6.

It is possible for packages to create symlinks to files outside of thenode_modules folder through the bin field upon installation.

Applications that do not call this function are not\nvulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by\napplications.\n\nThe SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used\nwhen processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected\nto succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have\nbeen identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.\n\nThe first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the\nnetwork and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived.\nIn this case calling SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though a record has only\nbeen partially processed and the buffer is still in use.\n\nThe second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has\nbeen received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of\nthis data. Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer\nis still in use.\n\nWhile these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a\nmalicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.\nWe are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4741","epss":0.0013,"percentile":0.33822,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.1.1y","3.0.14","3.1.6","3.2.2","3.3.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.09749999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-4741","versionConstraint":">= 1.1.1, < 1.1.1y,>= 3.0.0, < 3.0.14,>= 3.1.0, < 3.1.6,>= 3.2.0, < 3.2.2,>= 3.3.0, < 3.3.1 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.1y"}}],"artifact":{"id":"08ee522cf39d7fe7","name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/openssl","accessPath":"/usr/bin/openssl","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/openssl@1.1.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-4450","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4450","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=63bcf189be73a9cc1264059bed6f57974be74a83","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=bbcf509bd046b34cca19c766bbddc31683d0858b","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=63bcf189be73a9cc1264059bed6f57974be74a83","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=bbcf509bd046b34cca19c766bbddc31683d0858b","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt"],"description":"The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and\ndecodes the \"name\" (e.g. \"CERTIFICATE\"), any header data and the payload data.\nIf the function succeeds then the \"name_out\", \"header\" and \"data\" arguments are\npopulated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data.

is an HTTP authentication scheme providing mechanisms for making authenticated HTTP requests with partial cryptographic verification of the request and response, covering the HTTP method, request URI,

in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k).

has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can find a configuration file as well as certificates used for verification in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable with the --prefix / --openssldir configuration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix-like environment and the default prefix for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR should be '/usr/local'. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, find themselves looking at sub-directories of 'C:/usr/local', which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users to modify OpenSSL's default configuration, insert CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, '/usr/local/ssl' is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own --prefix. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":1.9,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-1552","epss":0.00208,"percentile":0.43751,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":""},"advisories":[],"risk":0.058239999999999986},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-1552","versionConstraint":">=

summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL\nto crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack\n\nImpact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format

The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but\nOpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12\nfiles from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will\nbe vulnerable to this issue.\n\nOpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),\nPKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()\nand PKCS12_newpass().\n\nWe have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7().
