is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing\ninside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but\nthe public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type\nof the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by\nthe OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an\nASN1_STRING.\n\nWhen CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the\nX509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass\narbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or\nenact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to\nprovide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a\nvalid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other\ninput must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which\nis uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect\napplications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs\nover a network.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-0286","epss":0.8576,"percentile":0.99335,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"cryptography","version":"2.6.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=0.8.1,<39.0.1 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-x4qr-2fvf-3mr5"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"39.0.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"1fa8b2723bf9ae09","name":"cryptography","version":"2.6.1","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cryptography-2.6.1.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cryptography-2.6.1.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cryptography-2.6.1.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cryptography-2.6.1.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["BSD or Apache License, Version 2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:cryptography.io:cryptography:2.6.1:*:*:*:*:python:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cryptography.io:cryptography:2.6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/cryptography@2.6.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2007-4559","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-4559","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-August/074290.html","http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-August/074292.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/26623","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/3022","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=263261","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CVBB7NU3YIRRDOKLYVN647WPRR3IAKR6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FI55PGL47ES3OU2FQPGEHOI2EK3S2OBH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KA4Z44ZAI4SY7THCFBUDNT5EEFO4XQ3A/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-06","http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-August/074290.html","http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-August/074292.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/26623","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/3022","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=263261","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CVBB7NU3YIRRDOKLYVN647WPRR3IAKR6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FI55PGL47ES3OU2FQPGEHOI2EK3S2OBH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KA4Z44ZAI4SY7THCFBUDNT5EEFO4XQ3A/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CVBB7NU3YIRRDOKLYVN647WPRR3IAKR6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FI55PGL47ES3OU2FQPGEHOI2EK3S2OBH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KA4Z44ZAI4SY7THCFBUDNT5EEFO4XQ3A/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-06"],"description":"Directory traversal vulnerability in the (1) extract and (2) extractall functions in the tarfile module in Python allows user-assisted remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via a ..

The conditions are: A user is allowed to supply the path or filename of an uploaded file, the supplied path or filename is not checked against unicode chars, the supplied pathname checked against an extension deny-list, not an allow-list, the supplied path or filename contains a unicode whitespace char in the extension, the uploaded file is stored in a directory that allows PHP code to be executed. Given these conditions are met a user can upload and execute arbitrary code on the system under attack. The unicode whitespace removal has been replaced with a rejection (exception). For 1.x users, upgrade to 1.1.4. For 2.x users, upgrade to 2.1.1.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","metrics":{"baseScore":9.3,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":10.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32708","epss":0.11272,"percentile":0.93183,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"php","namespace":"github:language:php","package":{"name":"league/flysystem","version":"1.0.37"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.1.4 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-9f46-5r25-5wfm"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.4"}}],"artifact":{"id":"71b832933c88906e","name":"league/flysystem","version":"1.0.37","type":"php-composer","locations":[{"path":"/htdocs/3rdparty/composer/installed.json","accessPath":"/htdocs/3rdparty/composer/installed.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"php","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:league/flysystem:league/flysystem:1.0.37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:composer/league/flysystem@1.0.37","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2020-7070","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7070","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2020-8184","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00045.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00067.html","https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=79699","https://hackerone.com/reports/895727","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/10/msg00008.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7EVDN7D3IB4EAI4D3ZOM2OJKQ5SD7K4E/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/P2J3ZZDHCSX65T5QWV4AHBN7MOJXBEKG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RRU57N3OSYZPOMFWPRDNVH7EMYOTSZ66/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202012-16","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20201016-0001/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4583-1/","https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4856","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-14","http://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2020-8184","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00045.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00067.html","https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=79699","https://hackerone.com/reports/895727","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/10/msg00008.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7EVDN7D3IB4EAI4D3ZOM2OJKQ5SD7K4E/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/P2J3ZZDHCSX65T5QWV4AHBN7MOJXBEKG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RRU57N3OSYZPOMFWPRDNVH7EMYOTSZ66/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202012-16","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20201016-0001/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4583-1/","https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4856","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-14"],"description":"In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.34, 7.3.x below 7.3.23 and 7.4.x below 7.4.11, when PHP is processing incoming HTTP cookie values, the cookie names are url-decoded.

This is fixed in: v2.7.17, v2.7.17rc1, v2.7.18, v2.7.18rc1; v3.5.10, v3.5.10rc1, v3.5.7, v3.5.8, v3.5.8rc1, v3.5.8rc2, v3.5.9; v3.6.10, v3.6.10rc1, v3.6.11, v3.6.11rc1, v3.6.12, v3.6.9, v3.6.9rc1; v3.7.3, v3.7.3rc1, v3.7.4, v3.7.4rc1, v3.7.4rc2, v3.7.5, v3.7.5rc1, v3.7.6, v3.7.6rc1, v3.7.7, v3.7.7rc1, v3.7.8, v3.7.8rc1, v3.7.9.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-9636","epss":0.05634,"percentile":0.8991,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.7.17","3.4.10","3.5.7","3.6.9","3.7.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":4.61988},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"2.7.12"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-9636","versionConstraint":">= 2.7.0, < 2.7.17,>= 3.0.0, < 3.4.10,>= 3.5.0, < 3.5.7,>= 3.6.0, < 3.6.9,>= 3.7.0, < 3.7.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.7.17"}}],"artifact":{"id":"74dc27ec36c075ab","name":"python","version":"2.7.12","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/python2.7","accessPath":"/usr/bin/python2.7","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@2.7.12","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-48565","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-48565","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://bugs.python.org/issue42051","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00022.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00017.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AFHYAGWBFBNUGWU6XWKBHTCV5NH77MB7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BAYWJD576JUKLHCWKDLMJSUGTRDKPF3M/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KZRZRJHWLZ7MOJNPQBWGJVXMVYDC5BRA/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0007/","https://bugs.python.org/issue42051","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00022.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00017.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AFHYAGWBFBNUGWU6XWKBHTCV5NH77MB7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BAYWJD576JUKLHCWKDLMJSUGTRDKPF3M/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KZRZRJHWLZ7MOJNPQBWGJVXMVYDC5BRA/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0007/"],"description":"An XML External Entity (XXE) issue was discovered in Python through 3.9.1.

Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request.

an extensible PHP HTTP client. `Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive information. In affected versions when using our Curl handler, it is possible to use the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option to specify an `Authorization` header. On making a request which responds with a redirect to a URI with a different origin (change in host, scheme or port), if we choose to follow it, we should remove the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option before continuing, stopping curl from appending the `Authorization` header to the new request. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a partial fix was implemented in Guzzle 7.4.2, where a change in host would trigger removal of the curl-added Authorization header, however this earlier fix did not cover change in scheme or change in port. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together. Alternatively, one can specify to use the Guzzle steam handler backend, rather than curl.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.7,"exploitabilityScore":3.2,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4,"exploitabilityScore":8,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.7,"exploitabilityScore":3.2,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-31090","epss":0.02787,"percentile":0.85427,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"php","namespace":"github:language:php","package":{"name":"guzzlehttp/guzzle","version":"6.3.3"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<6.5.8 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-25mq-v84q-4j7r"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.5.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ffa3ee8f361f8d8c","name":"guzzlehttp/guzzle","version":"6.3.3","type":"php-composer","locations":[{"path":"/htdocs/3rdparty/composer/installed.json","accessPath":"/htdocs/3rdparty/composer/installed.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"php","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:guzzlehttp/guzzle:guzzlehttp/guzzle:6.3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:composer/guzzlehttp/guzzle@6.3.3","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2019-11044","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11044","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=78862","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/N7GCOAE6KVHYJ3UQ4KLPLTGSLX6IRVRN/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XWRQPYXVG43Q7DXMXH6UVWMKWGUW552F/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200103-0002/","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-14","https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=78862","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/N7GCOAE6KVHYJ3UQ4KLPLTGSLX6IRVRN/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XWRQPYXVG43Q7DXMXH6UVWMKWGUW552F/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200103-0002/","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-14"],"description":"In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.26, 7.3.x below 7.3.13 and 7.4.0 on Windows, PHP link() function accepts filenames with embedded \\0 byte and treats them as terminating at that byte.

still allows an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly parsed.

is a community fork of symfony 1.4 with DIC, form enhancements, latest Swiftmailer, better performance, composer compatible and PHP 8 support. Symfony 1 has a gadget chain due to vulnerable Swift Mailer dependency that would enable an attacker to get remote code execution if a developer unserialize user input in his project. This vulnerability present no direct threat but is a vector that will enable remote code execution if a developper deserialize user untrusted data. Symfony 1 depends on Swift Mailer which is bundled by default in vendor directory in the default installation since 1.3.0. Swift Mailer classes implement some `__destruct()` methods. These methods are called when php destroys the object in memory. However, it is possible to include any object type in `$this->_keys` to make PHP access to another array/object properties than intended by the developer. In particular, it is possible to abuse the array access which is triggered on foreach($this->_keys ...) for any class implementing ArrayAccess interface. This may allow an attacker to execute any PHP command which leads to remote code execution. This issue has been addressed in version 1.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-28859","epss":0.01328,"percentile":0.79008,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"php","namespace":"github:language:php","package":{"name":"swiftmailer/swiftmailer","version":"v6.1.3"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=4.0.0,<6.2.5 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-wjv8-pxr6-5f4r"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.2.5"}}],"artifact":{"id":"76fe023ed779fea0","name":"swiftmailer/swiftmailer","version":"v6.1.3","type":"php-composer","locations":[{"path":"/htdocs/3rdparty/composer/installed.json","accessPath":"/htdocs/3rdparty/composer/installed.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"php","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:swiftmailer/swiftmailer:swiftmailer/swiftmailer:v6.1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:composer/swiftmailer/swiftmailer@v6.1.3","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2018-1060","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1060","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00040.html","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1042001","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2019:0327","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3041","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3505","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1260","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3725","https://bugs.python.org/issue32981","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-1060","https://docs.python.org/3.5/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-5-6-release-candidate-1","https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-6-5-release-candidate-1","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/09/msg00030.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/09/msg00031.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/46PVWY5LFP4BRPG3BVQ5QEEFYBVEXHCK/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AEZ5IQT7OF7Q2NCGIVABOWYGKO7YU3NJ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JSKPGPZQNTAULHW4UH63KGOOUIDE4RRB/","https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docLocale=en_US&docId=emr_na-hpesbst03951en_us","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-2/","https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4306","https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4307","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00040.html","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1042001","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2019:0327","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3041","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3505","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1260","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3725","https://bugs.python.org/issue32981","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-1060","https://docs.python.org/3.5/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-5-6-release-candidate-1","https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-6-5-release-candidate-1","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/09/msg00030.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/09/msg00031.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/46PVWY5LFP4BRPG3BVQ5QEEFYBVEXHCK/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AEZ5IQT7OF7Q2NCGIVABOWYGKO7YU3NJ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JSKPGPZQNTAULHW4UH63KGOOUIDE4RRB/","https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docLocale=en_US&docId=emr_na-hpesbst03951en_us","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-2/","https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4306","https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4307","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html"],"description":"python before versions 2.7.15, 3.4.9, 3.5.6rc1, 3.6.5rc1 and 3.7.0 is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking in pop3lib's apop() method.

Guzzle prior to versions 6.5.6 and 7.4.3 contains a vulnerability with the cookie middleware. The vulnerability is that it is not checked if the cookie domain equals the domain of the server which sets the cookie via the Set-Cookie header, allowing a malicious server to set cookies for unrelated domains. The cookie middleware is disabled by default, so most library consumers will not be affected by this issue. Only those who manually add the cookie middleware to the handler stack or construct the client with ['cookies' => true] are affected. Moreover, those who do not use the same Guzzle client to call multiple domains and have disabled redirect forwarding are not affected by this vulnerability. Guzzle versions 6.5.6 and 7.4.3 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, turn off the cookie middleware.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-29248","epss":0.00341,"percentile":0.56252,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"php","namespace":"github:language:php","package":{"name":"guzzlehttp/guzzle","version":"6.3.3"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<6.5.6 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-cwmx-hcrq-mhc3"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.5.6"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ffa3ee8f361f8d8c","name":"guzzlehttp/guzzle","version":"6.3.3","type":"php-composer","locations":[{"path":"/htdocs/3rdparty/composer/installed.json","accessPath":"/htdocs/3rdparty/composer/installed.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"php","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:guzzlehttp/guzzle:guzzlehttp/guzzle:6.3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:composer/guzzlehttp/guzzle@6.3.3","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2018-1000030","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000030","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Low","urls":["https://bugs.python.org/issue31530","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oyR9DAZjZK_SCn3mor6NRAYLJS6ueXaY/view","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201811-02","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-2/","https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sj3ee7xv55j36k7/AADwP-YfOYikBMuy32e0uvPFa?dl=0","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html","https://bugs.python.org/issue31530","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oyR9DAZjZK_SCn3mor6NRAYLJS6ueXaY/view","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201811-02","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-2/","https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sj3ee7xv55j36k7/AADwP-YfOYikBMuy32e0uvPFa?dl=0","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html"],"description":"Python 2.7.14 is vulnerable to a Heap-Buffer-Overflow as well as a Heap-Use-After-Free. Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":3.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":3.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2018-1000030","epss":0.00774,"percentile":0.72552,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":""},"advisories":[],"risk":0.25155},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"2.7.12"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-1000030","versionConstraint":"<= 2.7.14 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}}],"artifact":{"id":"74dc27ec36c075ab","name":"python","version":"2.7.12","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/python2.7","accessPath":"/usr/bin/python2.7","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@2.7.12","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-jjg7-2v4v-x38h","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jjg7-2v4v-x38h","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) vulnerable to denial of service from specially crafted inputs to idna.encode","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.2,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-3651","epss":0.00436,"percentile":0.62112,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.7"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.24416000000000004},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-3651","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3651","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/kjd/idna/commit/1d365e17e10d72d0b7876316fc7b9ca0eebdd38d","https://huntr.com/bounties/93d78d07-d791-4b39-a845-cbfabc44aadb","https://github.com/kjd/idna/commit/1d365e17e10d72d0b7876316fc7b9ca0eebdd38d","https://huntr.com/bounties/93d78d07-d791-4b39-a845-cbfabc44aadb"],"description":"A vulnerability was identified in the kjd/idna library, specifically within the `idna.encode()` function, affecting version 3.6.

In affected versions on making a request which responds with a redirect to a URI with a different port, if we choose to follow it, we should remove the `Authorization` and `Cookie` headers from the request, before containing. Previously, we would only consider a change in host or scheme. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a partial fix was implemented in Guzzle 7.4.2, where a change in host would trigger removal of the curl-added Authorization header, however this earlier fix did not cover change in scheme or change in port. An alternative approach would be to use your own redirect middleware, rather than ours, if you are unable to upgrade.

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-40217","epss":0.00284,"percentile":0.51662,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.8.18","3.9.18","3.10.13","3.11.5"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.14626},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"2.7.12"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-40217","versionConstraint":"<

issue was discovered in Python before 3.11.1. An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302.

Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised.

When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1.
