In versions prior to 21.0.0-beta.1, 20.0.1, 19.0.11, and 18.3.7, Electron is vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information. When following a redirect, Electron delays a check for redirecting to file:// URLs from other schemes. The contents of the file is not available to the renderer following the redirect, but if the redirect target is a SMB URL such as `file://some.website.com/`, then in some cases, Windows will connect to that server and attempt NTLM authentication, which can include sending hashed credentials.This issue has been patched in versions: 21.0.0-beta.1, 20.0.1, 19.0.11, and 18.3.7. Users are recommended to upgrade to the latest stable version of Electron. If upgrading isn't possible, this issue can be addressed without upgrading by preventing redirects to file:// URLs in the `WebContents.on('will-redirect')` event, for all WebContents as a workaround.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":7.2,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-36077","epss":0.00092,"percentile":0.27299,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"electron","version":"12.2.3"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<18.3.7 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-p2jh-44qj-pf2v"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"18.3.7"}}],"artifact":{"id":"c0569f8ef64dc6c6","name":"electron","version":"12.2.3","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/resources/app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/vuex-electron-store/node_modules/electron/package.json","accessPath":"/resources/app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/vuex-electron-store/node_modules/electron/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:electronjs:electron:12.2.3:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/electron@12.2.3","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-jchw-25xp-jwwc","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jchw-25xp-jwwc","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Follow Redirects improperly handles URLs in the url.parse() function","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-26159","epss":0.00072,"percentile":0.22655,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.15.4"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.039959999999999996},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-26159","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26159","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects/issues/235","https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects/pull/236","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZZ425BFKNBQ6AK7I5SAM56TWON5OF2XM/","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-FOLLOWREDIRECTS-6141137","https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects/issues/235","https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects/pull/236","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZZ425BFKNBQ6AK7I5SAM56TWON5OF2XM/","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-FOLLOWREDIRECTS-6141137"],"description":"Versions of the package follow-redirects before 1.15.4 are vulnerable to Improper Input Validation due to the improper handling of URLs by the url.parse() function.

This issue is only exploitable if an API exposed to the main world via `contextBridge` can return an object or array that contains a javascript object which cannot be serialized, for instance, a canvas rendering context. This would normally result in an exception being thrown `Error: object could not be cloned`. The app side workaround is to ensure that such a case is not possible.

A vulnerability in versions prior to 18.0.0-beta.6, 17.2.0, 16.2.6, and 15.5.5 allows a renderer with JS execution to obtain access to a new renderer process with `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` enabled which in turn allows effective access to `ipcRenderer`. The `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` option does not implicitly grant Node.js access. Rather, it depends on the existing sandbox setting. If an application is sandboxed, then `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` just gives access to the sandboxed renderer APIs, which include `ipcRenderer`. If the application then additionally exposes IPC messages without IPC `senderFrame` validation that perform privileged actions or return confidential data this access to `ipcRenderer` can in turn compromise your application / user even with the sandbox enabled. Electron versions 18.0.0-beta.6, 17.2.0, 16.2.6, and 15.5.5 contain a fix for this issue.

The issue occurs when passing absolute URLs rather than protocol-relative URLs to axios. Even if ⁠baseURL is set, axios sends the request to the specified absolute URL, potentially causing SSRF and credential leakage. This issue impacts both server-side and client-side usage of axios. This issue is fixed in 1.8.2.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":7.7},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27152","epss":0.00019,"percentile":0.0345,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"axios","version":"0.21.4"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.30.0 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-jr5f-v2jv-69x6"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.30.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a2d10ced9dc4fc93","name":"axios","version":"0.21.4","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/resources/app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/axios/package.json","accessPath":"/resources/app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/axios/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:axios:axios:0.21.4:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/axios@0.21.4","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-7x97-j373-85x5","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7x97-j373-85x5","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Electron vulnerable to out-of-package code execution when launched with arbitrary cwd","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.4,"impactScore":4.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39956","epss":0.0002,"percentile":0.03878,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["22.3.19"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.011099999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-39956","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39956","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-7x97-j373-85x5","https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-7x97-j373-85x5"],"description":"Electron is a framework which lets you write cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Electron apps that are launched as command line executables are impacted.   Specifically this issue can only be exploited if the following conditions are met: 1. The app is launched with an attacker-controlled working directory and 2. The attacker has the ability to write files to that working directory. This makes the risk quite low, in fact normally issues of this kind are considered outside of our threat model as similar to Chromium we exclude Physically Local Attacks but given the ability for this issue to bypass certain protections like ASAR Integrity it is being treated with higher importance.  This issue has been fixed in versions:`26.0.0-beta.13`, `25.4.1`, `24.7.1`, `23.3.13`, and `22.3.19`. There are no app side workarounds, users must update to a patched version of
