This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which fixes a similar bug in later versions of tar.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32804","epss":0.87712,"percentile":0.99436,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"2.2.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<3.2.2 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3jfq-g458-7qm9"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.2.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"1e1e1b0bb2217fb7","name":"tar","version":"2.2.2","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/joplin/node_modules/node-gyp/node_modules/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/joplin/node_modules/node-gyp/node_modules/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:2.2.2:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@2.2.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-27983","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27983","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16","https://hackerone.com/reports/2319584","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JDECX4BYZLMM4S4LALN4DPZ2HUTTPLKE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YDVFUH7ACZPYB3BS4SVILNOY7NQU73VW/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240510-0002/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16","https://hackerone.com/reports/2319584","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JDECX4BYZLMM4S4LALN4DPZ2HUTTPLKE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YDVFUH7ACZPYB3BS4SVILNOY7NQU73VW/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240510-0002/"],"description":"An attacker can make the Node.js HTTP/2 server completely unavailable by sending a small amount of HTTP/2 frames packets with a few HTTP/2 frames inside.

BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-0778","epss":0.06917,"percentile":0.90942,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["12.22.11","14.19.1","16.14.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":4.755437499999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:14.17.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"14.17.6"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-0778","versionConstraint":">= 12.13.0, < 12.22.11,>= 14.15.0, < 14.19.1,>= 16.13.0, < 16.14.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"14.19.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"e854e3f70ac59a05","name":"node","version":"14.17.6","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/node","accessPath":"/bin/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:14.17.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/node@14.17.6","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-hrpp-h998-j3pp","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hrpp-h998-j3pp","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"qs vulnerable to Prototype Pollution","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-24999","epss":0.05114,"percentile":0.89367,"date":"2025-06-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.5.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":3.8355},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-24999","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24999","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/expressjs/express/releases/tag/4.17.3","https://github.com/ljharb/qs/pull/428","https://github.com/n8tz/CVE-2022-24999","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00039.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230908-0005/","https://github.com/expressjs/express/releases/tag/4.17.3","https://github.com/ljharb/qs/pull/428","https://github.com/n8tz/CVE-2022-24999","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00039.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230908-0005/"],"description":"qs before 6.10.3, as used in Express before 4.17.3 and other products, allows attackers to cause a Node process hang for an Express application because an __ proto__ key can be used.

Affected versions of moment were found to use an inefficient parsing algorithm. Specifically using string-to-date parsing in moment (more specifically rfc2822 parsing, which is tried by default) has quadratic (N^2) complexity on specific inputs. Users may notice a noticeable slowdown is observed with inputs above 10k characters. Users who pass user-provided strings without sanity length checks to moment constructor are vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks. The problem is patched in 2.29.4, the patch can be applied to all affected versions with minimal tweaking. Users are advised to upgrade.

npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does.

In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways: 1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the --max-http-header-size=size and/or the maxHeaderSize options so that no more headers than the server.maxHeadersCount limit can be sent. 2. Set server.maxHeadersCount to 0 so that no limit is applied.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37890","epss":0.0032,"percentile":0.54565,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"ws","version":"7.5.5"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=7.0.0,<7.5.10 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"7.5.10"}}],"artifact":{"id":"5df2ebfe715a13ad","name":"ws","version":"7.5.5","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/joplin/node_modules/ws/package.json","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/joplin/node_modules/ws/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:ws_project:ws:7.5.5:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/ws@7.5.5","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-23919","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23919","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://hackerone.com/reports/1808596","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/february-2023-security-releases/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230316-0008/","https://hackerone.com/reports/1808596","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/february-2023-security-releases/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230316-0008/"],"description":"A cryptographic vulnerability exists in Node.js <19.2.0, <18.14.1, <16.19.1, <14.21.3 that in some cases did does not clear the OpenSSL error stack after operations that may set it.

Highlight.js versions before 9.18.2 and 10.1.2 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. A malicious HTML code block can be crafted that will result in prototype pollution of the base object's prototype during highlighting. If you allow users to insert custom HTML code blocks into your page/app via parsing Markdown code blocks (or similar) and do not filter the language names the user can provide you may be vulnerable.

is a JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams. An attacker is able to inject arbitrary `CSS` into the generated graph allowing them to change the styling of elements outside of the generated graph, and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information by using specially crafted `CSS` selectors. The following example shows how an attacker can exfiltrate the contents of an input field by bruteforcing the `value` attribute one character at a time. Whenever there is an actual match, an `http` request will be made by the browser in order to \"load\" a background image that will let an attacker know what's the value of the character. This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure` via CSS selectors and functions able to generate HTTP requests. This also allows an attacker to change the document in ways which may lead a user to perform unintended actions, such as clicking on a link, etc. This issue has been resolved in version 9.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that user input is adequately escaped before embedding it in CSS blocks.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-31108","epss":0.00146,"percentile":0.36247,"date":"2025-06-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"mermaid","version":"8.13.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=8.0.0,<9.1.2
