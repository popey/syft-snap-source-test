Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":6.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cret@cert.org","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-9511","epss":0.13948,"percentile":0.93946,"date":"2025-06-04"}],"fix":{"versions":["8.16.1","10.16.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":10.53074},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:8.12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"8.12.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-9511","versionConstraint":">= 10.13.0, < 10.16.3,>= 8.9.0, < 8.16.1 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"8.16.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"9f302b434bdeaed8","name":"node","version":"8.12.0","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/node","accessPath":"/bin/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:8.12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/node@8.12.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2018-1000168","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000168","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103952","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0366","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0367","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/10/msg00011.html","https://nghttp2.org/blog/2018/04/12/nghttp2-v1-31-1/","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/june-2018-security-releases/","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103952","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0366","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0367","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/10/msg00011.html","https://nghttp2.org/blog/2018/04/12/nghttp2-v1-31-1/","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/june-2018-security-releases/"],"description":"nghttp2 version >= 1.10.0 and nghttp2 <= v1.31.0 contains an Improper Input Validation CWE-20 vulnerability in ALTSVC frame handling that can result in segmentation fault leading to denial of service.

Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":6.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cret@cert.org","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-9514","epss":0.05219,"percentile":0.89431,"date":"2025-06-04"}],"fix":{"versions":["8.16.1","10.16.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":3.9403449999999998},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:8.12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"8.12.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-9514","versionConstraint":">= 10.13.0, < 10.16.3,>= 8.9.0, < 8.16.1 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"8.16.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"9f302b434bdeaed8","name":"node","version":"8.12.0","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/node","accessPath":"/bin/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:8.12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/node@8.12.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-48565","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-48565","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://bugs.python.org/issue42051","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00022.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00017.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AFHYAGWBFBNUGWU6XWKBHTCV5NH77MB7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BAYWJD576JUKLHCWKDLMJSUGTRDKPF3M/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KZRZRJHWLZ7MOJNPQBWGJVXMVYDC5BRA/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0007/","https://bugs.python.org/issue42051","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00022.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00017.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AFHYAGWBFBNUGWU6XWKBHTCV5NH77MB7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BAYWJD576JUKLHCWKDLMJSUGTRDKPF3M/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KZRZRJHWLZ7MOJNPQBWGJVXMVYDC5BRA/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0007/"],"description":"An XML External Entity (XXE) issue was discovered in Python through 3.9.1.

an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL_shutdown() twice (once to send a close_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable \"non-stitched\" ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway).

This affects Python (CPython) through 3.7.12, 3.8.x through 3.8.12, 3.9.x through 3.9.10, and 3.10.x through 3.10.2.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-26488","epss":0.0089,"percentile":0.74428,"date":"2025-06-04"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.7.13","3.8.13","3.9.11","3.10.3","3.11.0b1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.5874},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.17:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"2.7.17"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-26488","versionConstraint":"< 3.7.13,>= 3.10.0a0, < 3.10.3,>= 3.11.0a0, < 3.11.0b1,>= 3.8.0a0, < 3.8.13,>= 3.9.0a0, < 3.9.11 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.7.13"}}],"artifact":{"id":"432369a4aa720a7f","name":"python","version":"2.7.17","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/python2.7","accessPath":"/usr/bin/python2.7","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:2.7.17:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.17:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@2.7.17","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-0938","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-0938","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/526617ed68cde460236c973e5d0a8bad4de896ba","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/90e526ae67b172ed7c6c56e7edad36263b0f9403","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/a7084f6075c9595ba60119ce8c62f1496f50c568","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/b8b4b713c5f8ec0958c7ef8d29d6711889bc94ab","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/d89a5f6a6e65511a5f6e0618c4c30a7aa5aba56a","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/ff4e5c25666f63544071a6b075ae8b25c98b7a32","https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105704","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/129418","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/K4EUG6EKV6JYFIC24BASYOZS4M5XOQIB/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250314-0002/"],"description":"The Python standard library functions `urllib.parse.urlsplit` and `urlparse` accepted domain names that included square brackets which isn't valid according to RFC 3986.

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-40217","epss":0.00284,"percentile":0.51534,"date":"2025-06-04"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.8.18","3.9.18","3.10.13","3.11.5"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.14626},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.17:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"2.7.17"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-40217","versionConstraint":"<

issue was discovered in Python before 3.11.1. An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-45061","epss":0.0008,"percentile":0.24592,"date":"2025-06-04"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.7.16","3.8.16","3.9.16","3.10.9","3.11.1","3.12.0a3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.060000000000000005},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.17:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"2.7.17"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-45061","versionConstraint":"<
