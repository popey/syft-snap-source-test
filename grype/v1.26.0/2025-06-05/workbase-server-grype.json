Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45288","epss":0.66635,"percentile":0.98417,"date":"2025-06-04"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.21.9","1.22.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":49.97625},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.13.4:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.13.4"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45288","versionConstraint":"<

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers.

The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45337","epss":0.36067,"percentile":0.96888,"date":"2025-06-04"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.0.0-20190911031432-227b76d455e7"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.31.0 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v778-237x-gjrc"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.31.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"813cdb97b8db4a19","name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.0.0-20190911031432-227b76d455e7","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/caddy","accessPath":"/bin/caddy","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:go:ssh:v0.0.0-20190911031432-227b76d455e7:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/crypto@v0.0.0-20190911031432-227b76d455e7","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.13.4","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:0hQKqeLdqlt5iIwVOBErRisrHJAN57yOiPRQItI20fU=","mainModule":"tmp/caddy/main"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Prototype Pollution in JSON5 via Parse Method","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":5.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-46175","epss":0.43543,"percentile":0.97342,"date":"2025-06-04"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.2.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":31.786389999999997},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-46175","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46175","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/199","https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/295","https://github.com/json5/json5/pull/298","https://github.com/json5/json5/security/advisories/GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/11/msg00021.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3S26TLPLVFAJTUN3VIXFDEBEXDYO22CE/","https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/199","https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/295","https://github.com/json5/json5/pull/298","https://github.com/json5/json5/security/advisories/GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/11/msg00021.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3S26TLPLVFAJTUN3VIXFDEBEXDYO22CE/"],"description":"JSON5 is an extension to the popular JSON file format that aims to be easier to write and maintain by hand (e.g. for config files).

BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m).

This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory.

Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1, with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped. This should be used with caution.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24538","epss":0.00335,"percentile":0.55725,"date":"2025-06-04"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.8","1.20.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.3149},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.13.4:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.13.4"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-24538","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.8,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"5a3017ef1ce67faf","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.13.4","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/caddy","accessPath":"/bin/caddy","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.13.4:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.13.4","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.13.4","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-29405","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29405","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/501224","https://go.dev/issue/60306","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/q5135a9d924/m/j0ZoAJOHAwAJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NZ2O6YCO2IZMZJELQGZYR2WAUNEDLYV6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XBS3IIK6ADV24C5ULQU55QLT2UE762ZX/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1842","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://go.dev/cl/501224","https://go.dev/issue/60306","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/q5135a9d924/m/j0ZoAJOHAwAJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NZ2O6YCO2IZMZJELQGZYR2WAUNEDLYV6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XBS3IIK6ADV24C5ULQU55QLT2UE762ZX/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1842","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241206-0003/"],"description":"The go command may execute arbitrary code at build time when using cgo.

X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a \"purpose\" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named \"purpose\" values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected

npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache.

By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persists.

X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.3,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-1971","epss":0.00264,"percentile":0.49664,"date":"2025-06-04"}],"fix":{"versions":["10.23.1","12.20.1","14.15.4"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.13332000000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:12.16.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"12.16.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-1971","versionConstraint":">= 10.13.0, < 10.23.1,>= 12.13.0, < 12.20.1,>= 14.15.0, < 14.15.4 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"12.20.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"724b501392e0834d","name":"node","version":"12.16.1","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/node","accessPath":"/bin/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:12.16.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/node@12.16.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-3xh2-74w9-5vxm","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3xh2-74w9-5vxm","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Integer overflow in github.com/gorilla/websocket","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-27813","epss":0.00177,"percentile":0.39979,"date":"2025-06-04"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.4.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.13275},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2020-27813","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27813","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1902111","https://github.com/gorilla/websocket/security/advisories/GHSA-jf24-p9p9-4rjh","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/01/msg00008.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00012.html","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1902111","https://github.com/gorilla/websocket/security/advisories/GHSA-jf24-p9p9-4rjh","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/01/msg00008.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00012.html"],"description":"An integer overflow vulnerability exists with the length of websocket frames received via a websocket connection.

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.0015,"percentile":0.36658,"date":"2025-06-04"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20190930134127-c5a3c61f89f3"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

The pollution should just be harmless data but this can cause problems for applications not expecting these properties to exist and can result in strange behavior or application crashes, i.e. a potential DOS vector.

is a compiler for writingJavaScript. In `@babel/traverse` prior to versions 7.23.2 and 8.0.0-alpha.4 and all versions of `babel-traverse`, using Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation, when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods. Known affected plugins are `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`; `@babel/preset-env` when using its `useBuiltIns` option; and any \"polyfill provider\" plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`, such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`. No other plugins under the `@babel/` namespace are impacted, but third-party plugins might be. Users that only compile trusted code are not impacted. The vulnerability has been fixed in `@babel/traverse@7.23.2` and `@babel/traverse@8.0.0-alpha.4`. Those who cannot upgrade `@babel/traverse` and are using one of the affected packages mentioned above should upgrade them to their latest version to avoid triggering the vulnerable code path in affected `@babel/traverse` versions: `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` v7.23.2, `@babel/preset-env` v7.23.2, `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` v0.4.3, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2` v0.4.6, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3` v0.8.5, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims` v0.10.0, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator` v0.5.3.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.1,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.3,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45133","epss":0.00067,"percentile":0.21231,"date":"2025-06-04"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"@babel/traverse","version":"7.12.9"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<7.23.2 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-67hx-6x53-jw92"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"7.23.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"d34d60970a4c358f","name":"@babel/traverse","version":"7.12.9","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/programs/server/npm/node_modules/meteor/babel-compiler/node_modules/@babel/traverse/package.json","accessPath":"/programs/server/npm/node_modules/meteor/babel-compiler/node_modules/@babel/traverse/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:@babel/traverse:@babel/traverse:7.12.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/%40babel/traverse@7.12.9","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-q6wq-5p59-983w","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q6wq-5p59-983w","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Cross site scripting in parse-url","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-2217","epss":0.0011,"percentile":0.30451,"date":"2025-06-04"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.0.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.06104999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-2217","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2217","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/ionicabizau/parse-url/commit/21c72ab9412228eea753e2abc48f8962707b1fe3","https://huntr.dev/bounties/4e046c63-b1ca-4bcc-b418-29796918a71b","https://github.com/ionicabizau/parse-url/commit/21c72ab9412228eea753e2abc48f8962707b1fe3","https://huntr.dev/bounties/4e046c63-b1ca-4bcc-b418-29796918a71b"],"description":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) -

form parsing can consume large amounts of CPU and memory when processing form inputs containing very large numbers of parts. This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts.

Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file.

Chunk extensions are a little-used HTTP feature which permit including additional metadata in a request or response body sent using the chunked encoding. The net/http chunked encoding reader discards this metadata. A sender can exploit this by inserting a large metadata segment with each byte transferred.

is an implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Versions `<= 8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library can be misconfigured so that passing a poorly implemented key retrieval function referring to the `secretOrPublicKey` argument from the readme link will result in incorrect verification of tokens. There is a possibility of using a different algorithm and key combination in verification, other than the one that was used to sign the tokens. Specifically, tokens signed with an asymmetric public key could be verified with a symmetric HS256 algorithm. This can lead to successful validation of  forged tokens.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 \"short path\" counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include a directory with one form of the path, followed by a symbolic link with a different string that resolves to the same file system entity, followed by a file using the first form. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink that had a different apparent name that resolved to the same entry in the filesystem, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar.

npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.16, 5.0.8, and 6.1.7 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit. A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.

It's likely that individual users do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees use of a new enough `@babel/helpers` version. Note that just updating Babel dependencies is not enough; one will also need to re-compile the code. No known workarounds are available.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.2,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27789","epss":0.0002,"percentile":0.03728,"date":"2025-06-04"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"@babel/runtime","version":"7.9.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<7.26.10 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"7.26.10"}}],"artifact":{"id":"d8f668071845800f","name":"@babel/runtime","version":"7.9.2","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/programs/server/npm/node_modules/@babel/runtime/package.json","accessPath":"/programs/server/npm/node_modules/@babel/runtime/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:@babel/runtime:@babel/runtime:7.9.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/%40babel/runtime@7.9.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-83g2-8m93-v3w7","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-83g2-8m93-v3w7","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"golang.org/x/net/html Infinite Loop vulnerability","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-33194","epss":0.00014,"percentile":0.01731,"date":"2025-06-04"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.0.0-20210520170846-37e1c6afe023"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.010499999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2021-33194","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33194","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/golang/net/commit/37e1c6afe02340126705deced573a85ab75209d7","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/wPunbCPkWUg","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4CHKSFMHZVOBCZSSVRE3UEYNKARTBMTM/","https://github.com/golang/net/commit/37e1c6afe02340126705deced573a85ab75209d7","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/wPunbCPkWUg","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4CHKSFMHZVOBCZSSVRE3UEYNKARTBMTM/"],"description":"golang.org/x/net before v0.0.0-20210520170846-37e1c6afe023 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via crafted ParseFragment input.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-33194","epss":0.00014,"percentile":0.01731,"date":"2025-06-04"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20190930134127-c5a3c61f89f3"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.0.0-20210520170846-37e1c6afe023 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-83g2-8m93-v3w7"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.0.0-20210520170846-37e1c6afe023"}}],"artifact":{"id":"1775bd1d71316332","name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20190930134127-c5a3c61f89f3","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/caddy","accessPath":"/bin/caddy","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:networking:v0.0.0-20190930134127-c5a3c61f89f3:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/net@v0.0.0-20190930134127-c5a3c61f89f3","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.13.4","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:6KET3Sqa7fkVfD63QnAM81ZeYg5n4HwApOJkufONnHA=","mainModule":"tmp/caddy/main"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-45284","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45284","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/540277","https://go.dev/issue/63713","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/4tU8LZfBFkY","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2186","https://go.dev/cl/540277","https://go.dev/issue/63713","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/4tU8LZfBFkY","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2186"],"description":"On Windows, The IsLocal function does not correctly detect reserved device names in some cases.
