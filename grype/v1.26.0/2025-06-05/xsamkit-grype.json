was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allows attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in some environments and local code execution in all environments. Log4j 2.16.0 (Java 8) and 2.12.2 (Java 7) fix this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.1,"exploitabilityScore":5,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"knownExploited":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-45046","vendorProject":"Apache","product":"Log4j2","dateAdded":"2023-05-01","requiredAction":"Apply updates per vendor instructions.","dueDate":"2023-05-22","knownRansomwareCampaignUse":"known","urls":["https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046"],"cwes":["CWE-917"]}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-45046","epss":0.94313,"percentile":0.99936,"date":"2025-06-04"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"log4j-core","version":"2.11.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<2.12.2 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.12.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"8d94c59484b39283","name":"log4j-core","version":"2.11.2","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/Xsamkit.jar","accessPath":"/Xsamkit.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:apache:log4j-core:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:log4j_core:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:log4j:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core@2.11.2","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/Xsamkit.jar:org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core","pomArtifactID":"log4j-core","pomGroupID":"org.apache.logging.log4j","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":null}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-mjmj-j48q-9wg2","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mjmj-j48q-9wg2","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"SnakeYaml Constructor Deserialization Remote Code Execution","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":8.3,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-1471","epss":0.93849,"percentile":0.99857,"date":"2025-06-04"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":74.14071000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-1471","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175095/PyTorch-Model-Server-Registration-Deserialization-Remote-Code-Execution.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/19/1","https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/issues/561/cve-2022-1471-vulnerability-in#comment-64581479","https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-mjmj-j48q-9wg2","https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec","https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-security-announce/c/mwrakFaEdnc","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230818-0015/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/","https://www.github.com/mbechler/marshalsec/blob/master/marshalsec.pdf?raw=true","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175095/PyTorch-Model-Server-Registration-Deserialization-Remote-Code-Execution.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/19/1","https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/issues/561/cve-2022-1471-vulnerability-in#comment-64581479","https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-mjmj-j48q-9wg2","https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec","https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-security-announce/c/mwrakFaEdnc","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230818-0015/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/","https://www.github.com/mbechler/marshalsec/blob/master/marshalsec.pdf?raw=true"],"description":"SnakeYaml's Constructor() class does not restrict types which can be instantiated during deserialization. Deserializing yaml content provided by an attacker can lead to remote code execution.
