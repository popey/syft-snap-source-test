Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":6.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cret@cert.org","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-9512","epss":0.22203,"percentile":0.95501,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20190620200207-3b0461eec859"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.0.0-20190813141303-74dc4d7220e7 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-hgr8-6h9x-f7q9"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.0.0-20190813141303-74dc4d7220e7"}}],"artifact":{"id":"1b4556357ab096fb","name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20190620200207-3b0461eec859","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/backbomb","accessPath":"/backbomb","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:networking:v0.0.0-20190620200207-3b0461eec859:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/net@v0.0.0-20190620200207-3b0461eec859","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.15.3","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:R/3boaszxrf1GEUWTVDzSKVwLmSJpwZ1yqXm8j0v2QI=","mainModule":"github.com/hahwul/backbomb"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-36xw-fx78-c5r4","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-36xw-fx78-c5r4","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"containerd-shim API Exposed to Host Network Containers","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.2,"exploitabilityScore":2.1,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-15257","epss":0.13631,"percentile":0.939,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.4.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":6.95181},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2020-15257","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15257","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/4a4bb851f5da563ff6e68a83dc837c7699c469ad","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.4.3","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-36xw-fx78-c5r4","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LNKXLOLZWO5FMAPX63ZL7JNKTNNT5NQD/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-33","https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4865","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/4a4bb851f5da563ff6e68a83dc837c7699c469ad","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.4.3","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-36xw-fx78-c5r4","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LNKXLOLZWO5FMAPX63ZL7JNKTNNT5NQD/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-33","https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4865"],"description":"containerd is an industry-standard container runtime and is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows. In containerd before versions 1.3.9 and 1.4.3, the containerd-shim API is improperly exposed to host network containers. Access controls for the shim’s API socket verified that the connecting process had an effective UID of 0, but did not otherwise restrict access to the abstract Unix domain socket. This would allow malicious containers running in the same network namespace as the shim, with an effective UID of 0 but otherwise reduced privileges, to cause new processes to be run with elevated privileges. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.9 and 1.4.3. Users should update to these versions as soon as they are released. It should be noted that containers started with an old version of containerd-shim should be stopped and restarted, as running containers will continue to be vulnerable even after an upgrade. If you are not providing the ability for untrusted users to start containers in the same network namespace as the shim (typically the \"host\" network namespace, for example with docker run --net=host or hostNetwork: true in a Kubernetes pod) and run with an effective UID of 0, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are running containers with a vulnerable configuration, you can deny access to all abstract sockets with AppArmor by adding a line similar to deny unix addr=@**, to your policy. It is best practice to run containers with a reduced set of privileges, with a non-zero UID, and with isolated namespaces. The containerd maintainers strongly advise against sharing namespaces with the host. Reducing the set of isolation mechanisms used for a container necessarily increases that container's privilege, regardless of what container runtime is used for running that container.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.2,"exploitabilityScore":2.1,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.6,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.2,"exploitabilityScore":2.1,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-15257","epss":0.13631,"percentile":0.939,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","version":"v1.4.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=1.4.0,<1.4.3 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-36xw-fx78-c5r4"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.4.3"}}],"artifact":{"id":"46dea3a78fac7115","name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","version":"v1.4.1","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/backbomb","accessPath":"/backbomb","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:containerd:containerd:v1.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/containerd/containerd@v1.4.1","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.15.3","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:pASeJT3R3YyVn+94qEPk0SnU1OQ20Jd/T+SPKy9xehY=","mainModule":"github.com/hahwul/backbomb"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-crp2-qrr5-8pq7","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-crp2-qrr5-8pq7","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"containerd CRI plugin: Insecure handling of image volumes","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-23648","epss":0.0617,"percentile":0.90378,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.4.13"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":4.6274999999999995},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-23648","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23648","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166421/containerd-Image-Volume-Insecure-Handling.html","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/10f428dac7cec44c864e1b830a4623af27a9fc70","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.4.13","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.5.10","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.6.1","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-crp2-qrr5-8pq7","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AUDQUQBZJGBWJPMRVB6QCCCRF7O3O4PA/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HFTS2EF3S7HNYSNZSEJZIJHPRU7OPUV3/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OCCARJ6FU4MWBTXHZNMS7NELPDBIX2VO/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202401-31","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5091","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166421/containerd-Image-Volume-Insecure-Handling.html","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/10f428dac7cec44c864e1b830a4623af27a9fc70","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.4.13","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.5.10","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.6.1","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-crp2-qrr5-8pq7","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AUDQUQBZJGBWJPMRVB6QCCCRF7O3O4PA/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HFTS2EF3S7HNYSNZSEJZIJHPRU7OPUV3/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OCCARJ6FU4MWBTXHZNMS7NELPDBIX2VO/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202401-31","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5091"],"description":"containerd is a container runtime available as a daemon for Linux and Windows.

A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where the data directory (typically `/var/lib/docker`) contained subdirectories with insufficiently restricted permissions, allowing otherwise unprivileged Linux users to traverse directory contents and execute programs. When containers included executable programs with extended permission bits (such as `setuid`), unprivileged Linux users could discover and execute those programs. When the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the host collided with the file owner or group inside a container, the unprivileged Linux user on the host could discover, read, and modify those files. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.9. Users should update to this version as soon as possible. Running containers should be stopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed.

The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in `dockerd` and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code.\n\nThe `overlay` network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with the VXLAN metadata, including a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the `u32` iptables extension provided by the `xt_u32` kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nAn iptables rule designates outgoing VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted overlay network for IPsec encapsulation.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks on affected platforms silently transmit unencrypted data. As a result, `overlay` networks may appear to be functional, passing traffic as expected, but without any of the expected confidentiality or data integrity guarantees.\n\nIt is possible for an attacker sitting in a trusted position on the network to read all of the application traffic that is moving across the overlay network, resulting in unexpected secrets or user data disclosure. Thus, because many database protocols, internal APIs, etc. are not protected by a second layer of encryption, a user may use Swarm encrypted overlay networks to provide confidentiality, which due to this vulnerability this is no longer guaranteed.\n\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3, and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Close the VXLAN port (by default, UDP port 4789) to outgoing traffic at the Internet boundary in order to prevent unintentionally leaking unencrypted traffic over the Internet, and/or ensure that the `xt_u32` kernel module is available on all nodes of the Swarm cluster.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28841","epss":0.02777,"percentile":0.85393,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac+incompatible"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=1.12.0,<20.10.24 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-33pg-m6jh-5237"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"20.10.24"}}],"artifact":{"id":"8ad06ce4d1e922fa","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/backbomb","accessPath":"/backbomb","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.15.3","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:ZxJX4ZSNg1LORBsStUojbrLfkrE3Ut122XhzyZnN110=","mainModule":"github.com/hahwul/backbomb"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-j249-ghv5-7mxv","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j249-ghv5-7mxv","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Secret insertion into debug log in Docker","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-13509","epss":0.01696,"percentile":0.81418,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["18.09.8"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":1.2719999999999998},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2019-13509","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13509","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-08/msg00084.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/109253","https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/N674WD3OBDPHLWY6EABRHQH5ON6SUJBU/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PFFBVE7O73TAVY2BCWXSA2OOSLJVCPXC/","https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Sep/21","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190828-0003/","https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4521","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-08/msg00084.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/109253","https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/N674WD3OBDPHLWY6EABRHQH5ON6SUJBU/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PFFBVE7O73TAVY2BCWXSA2OOSLJVCPXC/","https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Sep/21","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190828-0003/","https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4521"],"description":"In Docker CE and EE before 18.09.8 (as well as Docker EE before 17.06.2-ee-23 and 18.x before 18.03.1-ee-10), Docker Engine in debug mode may sometimes add secrets to the debug log.

is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby, is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in dockerd and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code.\n\nThe overlay network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the u32 iptables extension provided by the xt_u32 kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nTwo iptables rules serve to filter incoming VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted network and discards unencrypted datagrams. The rules are appended to the end of the INPUT filter chain, following any rules that have been previously set by the system administrator. Administrator-set rules take precedence over the rules Moby sets to discard unencrypted VXLAN datagrams, which can potentially admit unencrypted datagrams that should have been discarded.\n\nThe injection of arbitrary Ethernet frames can enable a Denial of Service attack. A sophisticated attacker may be able to establish a UDP or TCP connection by way of the container’s outbound gateway that would otherwise be blocked by a stateful firewall, or carry out other escalations beyond simple injection by smuggling packets into the overlay network.\n\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3 and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Close the VXLAN port (by default, UDP port 4789) to incoming traffic at the Internet boundary to prevent all VXLAN packet injection, and/or ensure that the `xt_u32` kernel module is available on all nodes of the Swarm cluster.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.7,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28840","epss":0.00425,"percentile":0.61402,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac+incompatible"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=1.12.0,<20.10.24 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-232p-vwff-86mp"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"20.10.24"}}],"artifact":{"id":"8ad06ce4d1e922fa","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/backbomb","accessPath":"/backbomb","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.15.3","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:ZxJX4ZSNg1LORBsStUojbrLfkrE3Ut122XhzyZnN110=","mainModule":"github.com/hahwul/backbomb"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-24538","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24538","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/482079","https://go.dev/issue/59234","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Xdv6JL9ENs8","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1703","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://go.dev/cl/482079","https://go.dev/issue/59234","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Xdv6JL9ENs8","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1703","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241115-0007/"],"description":"Templates do not properly consider backticks (`) as Javascript string delimiters, and do not escape them as expected. Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1, with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped.

is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in `dockerd` and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code.\n\nThe `overlay` network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with the VXLAN metadata, including a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the `u32` iptables extension provided by the `xt_u32` kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nThe `overlay` driver dynamically and lazily defines the kernel configuration for the VXLAN network on each node as containers are attached and detached. Routes and encryption parameters are only defined for destination nodes that participate in the network. The iptables rules that prevent encrypted overlay networks from accepting unencrypted packets are not created until a peer is available with which to communicate.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks silently accept cleartext VXLAN datagrams that are tagged with the VNI of an encrypted overlay network. As a result, it is possible to inject arbitrary Ethernet frames into the encrypted overlay network by encapsulating them in VXLAN datagrams. The implications of this can be quite dire, and GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw should be referenced for a deeper exploration.\n\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3, and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\nSome workarounds are available. In multi-node clusters, deploy a global ‘pause’ container for each encrypted overlay network, on every node. For a single-node cluster, do not use overlay networks of any sort. Bridge networks provide the same connectivity on a single node and have no multi-node features. The Swarm ingress feature is implemented using an overlay network, but can be disabled by publishing ports in `host` mode instead of `ingress` mode (allowing the use of an external load balancer), and removing the `ingress` network. If encrypted overlay networks are in exclusive use, block UDP port 4789 from traffic that has not been validated by IPSec.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28842","epss":0.00403,"percentile":0.60095,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac+incompatible"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=1.12.0,<20.10.24 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-6wrf-mxfj-pf5p"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"20.10.24"}}],"artifact":{"id":"8ad06ce4d1e922fa","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/backbomb","accessPath":"/backbomb","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.15.3","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:ZxJX4ZSNg1LORBsStUojbrLfkrE3Ut122XhzyZnN110=","mainModule":"github.com/hahwul/backbomb"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-24540","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24540","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/491616","https://go.dev/issue/59721","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/MEb0UyuSMsU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1752","https://go.dev/cl/491616","https://go.dev/issue/59721","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/MEb0UyuSMsU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1752","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241115-0008/"],"description":"Not all valid JavaScript whitespace characters are considered to be whitespace.

is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in containerd's CRI implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host. In the CRI stream server, a goroutine is launched to handle terminal resize events if a TTY is requested. If the user's process fails to launch due to, for example, a faulty command, the goroutine will be stuck waiting to send without a receiver, resulting in a memory leak. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation and the stream server is used for handling container IO. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.12 and 1.5.16.  Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used and that only trusted users have permissions to execute commands in running containers.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.7,"exploitabilityScore":2.1,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-23471","epss":0.00198,"percentile":0.42512,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","version":"v1.4.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.5.16 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-2qjp-425j-52j9"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.5.16"}}],"artifact":{"id":"46dea3a78fac7115","name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","version":"v1.4.1","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/backbomb","accessPath":"/backbomb","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:containerd:containerd:v1.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/containerd/containerd@v1.4.1","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.15.3","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:pASeJT3R3YyVn+94qEPk0SnU1OQ20Jd/T+SPKy9xehY=","mainModule":"github.com/hahwul/backbomb"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-34156","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34156","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/611239","https://go.dev/issue/69139","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/S9POB9NCTdk","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-3106","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240926-0004/"],"description":"Calling Decoder.Decode on a message which contains deeply nested structures can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

Moby's networking implementation allows for many networks, each with their own IP address range and gateway, to be defined. This feature is frequently referred to as custom networks, as each network can have a different driver, set of parameters and thus behaviors. When creating a network, the `--internal` flag is used to designate a network as _internal_. The `internal` attribute in a docker-compose.yml file may also be used to mark a network _internal_, and other API clients may specify the `internal` parameter as well.\n\nWhen containers with networking are created, they are assigned unique network interfaces and IP addresses. The host serves as a router for non-internal networks, with a gateway IP that provides SNAT/DNAT to/from container IPs.\n\nContainers on an internal network may communicate between each other, but are precluded from communicating with any networks the host has access to (LAN or WAN) as no default route is configured, and firewall rules are set up to drop all outgoing traffic. Communication with the gateway IP address (and thus appropriately configured host services) is possible, and the host may communicate with any container IP directly.\n\nIn addition to configuring the Linux kernel's various networking features to enable container networking, `dockerd` directly provides some services to container networks. Principal among these is serving as a resolver, enabling service discovery, and resolution of names from an upstream resolver.\n\nWhen a DNS request for a name that does not correspond to a container is received, the request is forwarded to the configured upstream resolver. This request is made from the container's network namespace: the level of access and routing of traffic is the same as if the request was made by the container itself.\n\nAs a consequence of this design, containers solely attached to an internal network will be unable to resolve names using the upstream resolver, as the container itself is unable to communicate with that nameserver. Only the names of containers also attached to the internal network are able to be resolved.\n\nMany systems run a local forwarding DNS resolver. As the host and any containers have separate loopback devices, a consequence of the design described above is that containers are unable to resolve names from the host's configured resolver, as they cannot reach these addresses on the host loopback device. To bridge this gap, and to allow containers to properly resolve names even when a local forwarding resolver is used on a loopback address, `dockerd` detects this scenario and instead forward DNS requests from the host namework namespace. The loopback resolver then forwards the requests to its configured upstream resolvers, as expected.\n\nBecause `dockerd` forwards DNS requests to the host loopback device, bypassing the container network namespace's normal routing semantics entirely, internal networks can unexpectedly forward DNS requests to an external nameserver. By registering a domain for which they control the authoritative nameservers, an attacker could arrange for a compromised container to exfiltrate data by encoding it in DNS queries that will eventually be answered by their nameservers.\n\nDocker Desktop is not affected, as Docker Desktop always runs an internal resolver on a RFC 1918 address.\n\nMoby releases 26.0.0, 25.0.4, and 23.0.11 are patched to prevent forwarding any DNS requests from internal networks. As a workaround, run containers intended to be solely attached to internal networks with a custom upstream address, which will force all upstream DNS queries to be resolved from the container's network namespace.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-29018","epss":0.00143,"percentile":0.35745,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac+incompatible"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<23.0.11 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-mq39-4gv4-mvpx"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"23.0.11"}}],"artifact":{"id":"8ad06ce4d1e922fa","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/backbomb","accessPath":"/backbomb","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.15.3","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:ZxJX4ZSNg1LORBsStUojbrLfkrE3Ut122XhzyZnN110=","mainModule":"github.com/hahwul/backbomb"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-p782-xgp4-8hr8","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p782-xgp4-8hr8","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"golang.org/x/sys/unix has Incorrect privilege reporting in syscall","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-29526","epss":0.00149,"percentile":0.36633,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.0.0-20220412211240-33da011f77ad"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.076735},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-29526","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29526","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/golang/go/issues/52313","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Y5qrqw_lWdU","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Q6GE5EQGE4L2KRVGW4T75QVIYAXCLO5X/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RQXU752ALW53OJAF5MG3WMR5CCZVLWW6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z55VUVGO7E5PJFXIOVAY373NZRHBNCI5/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZY2SLWOQR4ZURQ7UBRZ7JIX6H6F5JHJR/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-02","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220729-0001/","https://github.com/golang/go/issues/52313","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Y5qrqw_lWdU","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Q6GE5EQGE4L2KRVGW4T75QVIYAXCLO5X/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RQXU752ALW53OJAF5MG3WMR5CCZVLWW6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z55VUVGO7E5PJFXIOVAY373NZRHBNCI5/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZY2SLWOQR4ZURQ7UBRZ7JIX6H6F5JHJR/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-02","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220729-0001/"],"description":"Go before 1.17.10 and 1.18.x before 1.18.2 has Incorrect Privilege Assignment.

is a container runtime. A bug was found in containerd versions prior to 1.4.8 and 1.5.4 where pulling and extracting a specially-crafted container image can result in Unix file permission changes for existing files in the host’s filesystem. Changes to file permissions can deny access to the expected owner of the file, widen access to others, or set extended bits like setuid, setgid, and sticky. This bug does not directly allow files to be read, modified, or executed without an additional cooperating process. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.5.4 and 1.4.8. As a workaround, ensure that users only pull images from trusted sources. Linux security modules (LSMs) like SELinux and AppArmor can limit the files potentially affected by this bug through policies and profiles that prevent containerd from interacting with specific files.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":6.3,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32760","epss":0.00141,"percentile":0.35507,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","version":"v1.4.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.4.8

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20190620200207-3b0461eec859"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.17.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"1b4556357ab096fb","name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20190620200207-3b0461eec859","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/backbomb","accessPath":"/backbomb","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:networking:v0.0.0-20190620200207-3b0461eec859:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/net@v0.0.0-20190620200207-3b0461eec859","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.15.3","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:R/3boaszxrf1GEUWTVDzSKVwLmSJpwZ1yqXm8j0v2QI=","mainModule":"github.com/hahwul/backbomb"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-41722","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41722","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/468123","https://go.dev/issue/57274","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1568","https://go.dev/cl/468123","https://go.dev/issue/57274","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1568"],"description":"A path traversal vulnerability exists in filepath.Clean on Windows.

A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted. This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset. This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. As a workaround, the entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.6,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-24769","epss":0.00111,"percentile":0.30664,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac+incompatible"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<20.10.14 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-2mm7-x5h6-5pvq"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"20.10.14"}}],"artifact":{"id":"8ad06ce4d1e922fa","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/backbomb","accessPath":"/backbomb","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.15.3","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:ZxJX4ZSNg1LORBsStUojbrLfkrE3Ut122XhzyZnN110=","mainModule":"github.com/hahwul/backbomb"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-259w-8hf6-59c2","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-259w-8hf6-59c2","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"OCI image importer memory exhaustion in github.com/containerd/containerd","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-25153","epss":0.00115,"percentile":0.31419,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.5.18"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.060375},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-25153","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25153","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/0c314901076a74a7b797a545d2f462285fdbb8c4","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.5.18","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.6.18","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-259w-8hf6-59c2","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/0c314901076a74a7b797a545d2f462285fdbb8c4","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.5.18","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.6.18","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-259w-8hf6-59c2"],"description":"containerd is an open source container runtime.

form parsing can consume large amounts of CPU and memory when processing form inputs containing very large numbers of parts. This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In addition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxheaders=.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24536","epss":0.00066,"percentile":0.20845,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.8","1.20.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0495},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.15.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.15.3"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-24536","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.8,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"dacf37eab8463dbc","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.15.3","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/backbomb","accessPath":"/backbomb","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.15.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.15.3","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.15.3","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-24539","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24539","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/491615","https://go.dev/issue/59720","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/MEb0UyuSMsU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1751","https://go.dev/cl/491615","https://go.dev/issue/59720","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/MEb0UyuSMsU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1751","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241129-0005/"],"description":"Angle brackets (<>) are not considered dangerous characters when inserted into CSS contexts.

Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":2.1,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-31030","epss":0.00085,"percentile":0.25886,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","version":"v1.4.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.5.13 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-5ffw-gxpp-mxpf"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.5.13"}}],"artifact":{"id":"46dea3a78fac7115","name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","version":"v1.4.1","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/backbomb","accessPath":"/backbomb","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:containerd:containerd:v1.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/containerd/containerd@v1.4.1","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.15.3","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:pASeJT3R3YyVn+94qEPk0SnU1OQ20Jd/T+SPKy9xehY=","mainModule":"github.com/hahwul/backbomb"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-2wrh-6pvc-2jm9","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2wrh-6pvc-2jm9","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Improper rendering of text nodes in golang.org/x/net/html","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-3978","epss":0.00078,"percentile":0.24378,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.13.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.043289999999999995},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-3978","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3978","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/514896","https://go.dev/issue/61615","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1988","https://go.dev/cl/514896","https://go.dev/issue/61615","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1988"],"description":"Text nodes not in the HTML namespace are incorrectly literally rendered, causing text which should be escaped to not be.

Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41725","epss":0.00051,"percentile":0.15979,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.6"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.038250000000000006},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.15.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.15.3"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-41725","versionConstraint":"<

is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where supplementary groups are not set up properly. If an attacker has direct access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group access, they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary group restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or gaining the ability to execute code in that container.  This bug is fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.18. Running containers should be stopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed. For users unable to upgrade, this problem can be worked around by not using the `\"USER $USERNAME\"` Dockerfile instruction. Instead by calling `ENTRYPOINT [\"su\", \"-\", \"user\"]` the supplementary groups will be set up properly.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":6.3,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-36109","epss":0.00044,"percentile":0.1312,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac+incompatible"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<20.10.18 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-rc4r-wh2q-q6c4"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"20.10.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"8ad06ce4d1e922fa","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/backbomb","accessPath":"/backbomb","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200505174321-1655290016ac%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.15.3","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:ZxJX4ZSNg1LORBsStUojbrLfkrE3Ut122XhzyZnN110=","mainModule":"github.com/hahwul/backbomb"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-2880","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2880","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/432976","https://go.dev/issue/54663","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/xtuG5faxtaU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-1038","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://go.dev/cl/432976","https://go.dev/issue/54663","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/xtuG5faxtaU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-1038","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09"],"description":"Requests forwarded by ReverseProxy include the raw query parameters from the inbound request, including unparsable parameters rejected by net/http.

A bug was found in containerd prior to versions 1.6.18 and 1.5.18 where supplementary groups are not set up properly inside a container. If an attacker has direct access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group access, they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary group restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or gaining the ability to execute code in that container. Downstream applications that use the containerd client library may be affected as well.\n\nThis bug has been fixed in containerd v1.6.18 and v.1.5.18. Users should update to these versions and recreate containers to resolve this issue. Users who rely on a downstream application that uses containerd's client library should check that application for a separate advisory and instructions. As a workaround, ensure that the `\"USER $USERNAME\"` Dockerfile instruction is not used.
