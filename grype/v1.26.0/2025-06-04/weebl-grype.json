vulnerability has been identified in the Node.js (.msi version) installation process, specifically affecting Windows users who install Node.js using the .msi installer. This vulnerability emerges during the repair operation, where the \"msiexec.exe\" process, running under the NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM context, attempts to read the %USERPROFILE% environment variable from the current user's registry.\n\nThe issue arises when the path referenced by the %USERPROFILE% environment variable does not exist. In such cases, the \"msiexec.exe\" process attempts to create the specified path in an unsafe manner, potentially leading to the creation of arbitrary folders in arbitrary locations.\n\nThe severity of this vulnerability is heightened by the fact that the %USERPROFILE% environment variable in the Windows registry can be modified by standard (or \"non-privileged\") users. Consequently, unprivileged actors, including malicious entities or trojans, can manipulate the environment variable key to deceive the privileged \"msiexec.exe\" process. This manipulation can result in the creation of folders in unintended and potentially malicious locations.\n\nIt is important to note that this vulnerability is specific to Windows users who install Node.js using the .msi installer. Users who opt for other installation methods are not affected by this particular issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-30585","epss":0.0108,"percentile":0.76823,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["16.20.1","18.16.1","20.3.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.8099999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:16.14.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"16.14.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-30585","versionConstraint":">= 16.0.0, < 16.20.1,>= 18.0.0, < 18.16.1,>= 20.0.0, < 20.3.1 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"16.20.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a15144b565fc8d61","name":"node","version":"16.14.2","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/node","accessPath":"/bin/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:16.14.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/node@16.14.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-35255","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35255","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-332410.pdf","https://hackerone.com/reports/1690000","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230113-0002/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5326","https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-332410.pdf","https://hackerone.com/reports/1690000","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230113-0002/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5326"],"description":"A weak randomness in WebCrypto keygen vulnerability exists in Node.js 18 due to a change with EntropySource() in SecretKeyGenTraits::DoKeyGen() in src/crypto/crypto_keygen.cc.

vulnerability in Node.js has been identified, allowing for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack through resource exhaustion when using the fetch() function to retrieve content from an untrusted URL.\nThe vulnerability stems from the fact that the fetch() function in Node.js always decodes Brotli, making it possible for an attacker to cause resource exhaustion when fetching content from an untrusted
