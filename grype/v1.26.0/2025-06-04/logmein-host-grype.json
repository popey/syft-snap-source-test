This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which fixes a similar bug in later versions of tar.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32804","epss":0.87712,"percentile":0.99436,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"4.4.13"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=4.0.0,<4.4.14 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3jfq-g458-7qm9"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"4.4.14"}}],"artifact":{"id":"98cdd3fe6e25217e","name":"tar","version":"4.4.13","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/node_modules/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/node_modules/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:4.4.13:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@4.4.13","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2007-4559","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-4559","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-August/074290.html","http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-August/074292.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/26623","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/3022","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=263261","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CVBB7NU3YIRRDOKLYVN647WPRR3IAKR6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FI55PGL47ES3OU2FQPGEHOI2EK3S2OBH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KA4Z44ZAI4SY7THCFBUDNT5EEFO4XQ3A/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-06","http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-August/074290.html","http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-August/074292.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/26623","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/3022","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=263261","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CVBB7NU3YIRRDOKLYVN647WPRR3IAKR6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FI55PGL47ES3OU2FQPGEHOI2EK3S2OBH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KA4Z44ZAI4SY7THCFBUDNT5EEFO4XQ3A/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CVBB7NU3YIRRDOKLYVN647WPRR3IAKR6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FI55PGL47ES3OU2FQPGEHOI2EK3S2OBH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KA4Z44ZAI4SY7THCFBUDNT5EEFO4XQ3A/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-06"],"description":"Directory traversal vulnerability in the (1) extract and (2) extractall functions in the tarfile module in Python allows user-assisted remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via a ..

The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including versions 1.0.1 and 2.2.1 does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse` should restrict parsing of `__proto__` keys when parsing JSON strings to objects. As a point of reference, the `JSON.parse` method included in JavaScript ignores `__proto__` keys. Simply changing `JSON5.parse` to `JSON.parse` in the examples above mitigates this vulnerability. This vulnerability is patched in json5 versions 1.0.2, 2.2.2, and later.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":5.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-46175","epss":0.41091,"percentile":0.97228,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"json5","version":"1.0.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.0.2

npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-37713","epss":0.00938,"percentile":0.75192,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"4.4.13"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<4.4.18

A request with a number of headers exceeding theserver.maxHeadersCount threshold could be used to crash a ws server. The vulnerability was fixed in ws@8.17.1 (e55e510) and backported to ws@7.5.10 (22c2876), ws@6.2.3 (eeb76d3), and ws@5.2.4 (4abd8f6).

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32803","epss":0.00208,"percentile":0.43703,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"4.4.13"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=4.0.0,<4.4.15 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"4.4.15"}}],"artifact":{"id":"98cdd3fe6e25217e","name":"tar","version":"4.4.13","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/node_modules/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/node_modules/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:4.4.13:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@4.4.13","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-5xp3-jfq3-5q8x","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5xp3-jfq3-5q8x","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Improper Input Validation in pip","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.7,"exploitabilityScore":2.1,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-3572","epss":0.0024,"percentile":0.4753,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["21.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.15839999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2021-3572","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3572","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1962856","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1962856","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"],"description":"A flaw was found in python-pip in the way it handled Unicode separators in git references.

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer.

Because JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and lead to a DoS. The bad regular expression is generated any time you have two parameters within a single segment, separated by something that is not a period (.). For users of 0.1, upgrade to 0.1.10.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 \"short path\" counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include a directory with one form of the path, followed by a symbolic link with a different string that resolves to the same file system entity, followed by a file using the first form. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink that had a different apparent name that resolved to the same entry in the filesystem, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. If this is not possible, a workaround is available in the referenced GHSA-qq89-hq3f-393p.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-37712","epss":0.00023,"percentile":0.04622,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"4.4.13"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=3.0.0,<4.4.18 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-qq89-hq3f-393p"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"4.4.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"98cdd3fe6e25217e","name":"tar","version":"4.4.13","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/node_modules/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/node_modules/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:4.4.13:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@4.4.13","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-23085","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23085","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/january-2025-security-releases","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/02/msg00031.html"],"description":"A memory leak could occur when a remote peer abruptly closes the socket without sending a GOAWAY notification.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit. A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. If this is not possible, a workaround is available in the referenced GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-37701","epss":0.00016,"percentile":0.02434,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"4.4.13"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=3.0.0,<4.4.16 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"4.4.16"}}],"artifact":{"id":"98cdd3fe6e25217e","name":"tar","version":"4.4.13","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/node_modules/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/node_modules/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:4.4.13:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@4.4.13","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-pxg6-pf52-xh8x","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pxg6-pf52-xh8x","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"cookie accepts cookie name, path, and domain with out of bounds characters","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-47764","epss":0.0004,"percentile":0.11368,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.7.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.012},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-47764","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47764","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/jshttp/cookie/commit/e10042845354fea83bd8f34af72475eed1dadf5c","https://github.com/jshttp/cookie/pull/167","https://github.com/jshttp/cookie/security/advisories/GHSA-pxg6-pf52-xh8x"],"description":"cookie is a basic HTTP cookie parser and serializer for HTTP servers.

The fix adds support for Unix “700” for the mkdir function on Windows which is used by mkdtemp() to ensure the newly created directory has the proper permissions.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4030","epss":0.00014,"percentile":0.01528,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.8.20","3.9.20","3.10.15","3.11.10","3.12.4","3.13.0b1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.01022},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.6.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.9"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-4030","versionConstraint":"< 3.8.20,>= 3.10.0, < 3.10.15,>= 3.11.0, < 3.11.10,>= 3.12.0, < 3.12.4,>= 3.13.0a1, < 3.13.0b1,>= 3.9.0, < 3.9.20 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.8.20"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ca444138f2460464","name":"python","version":"3.6.9","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/python3.6","accessPath":"/usr/bin/python3.6","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:3.6.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.6.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@3.6.9","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-4516","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4516","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/4398b788ffc1f954a2c552da285477d42a571292","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/6279eb8c076d89d3739a6edb393e43c7929b429d","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/69b4387f78f413e8c47572a85b3478c47eba8142","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/73b3040f592436385007918887b7e2132aa8431f","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/8d35fd1b34935221aff23a1ab69a429dd156be77","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/9f69a58623bd01349a18ba0c7a9cb1dad6a51e8e","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/ab9893c40609935e0d40a6d2a7307ea51aec598b","https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/133767","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/129648","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/L75IPBBTSCYEF56I2M4KIW353BB3AY74/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/05/16/4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/05/19/1"],"description":"There is an issue in CPython when using `bytes.decode(\"unicode_escape\", error=\"ignore|replace\")`.
