A crafted CONFIG SET command can lead to an out of bounds write potentially resulting in code execution.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"talos-cna@cisco.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.6,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2016-8339","epss":0.0336,"percentile":0.86797,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":""},"advisories":[],"risk":2.8504},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:3.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"redis","version":"3.2.3"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2016-8339","versionConstraint":"= 3.2.0,= 3.2.1,= 3.2.2,= 3.2.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}}],"artifact":{"id":"fb1cb5db7ea72ac3","name":"redis","version":"3.2.3","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/redis-server","accessPath":"/bin/redis-server","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:3.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:3.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/redis@3.2.3","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-25155","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25155","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/2a2a582e7cd99ba3b531336b8bd41df2b566e619","https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/6.0.18","https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/6.2.11","https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/7.0.9","https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-x2r7-j9vw-3w83","https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/2a2a582e7cd99ba3b531336b8bd41df2b566e619","https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/6.0.18","https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/6.2.11","https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/7.0.9","https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-x2r7-j9vw-3w83"],"description":"Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk.

By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script execution environment, an attacker with access to Redis prior to version 7.0.0 or 6.2.7 can inject Lua code that will execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis user. The Lua script execution environment in Redis provides some measures that prevent a script from creating side effects that persist and can affect the execution of the same, or different script, at a later time. Several weaknesses of these measures have been publicly known for a long time, but they had no security impact as the Redis security model did not endorse the concept of users or privileges. With the introduction of ACLs in Redis 6.0, these weaknesses can be exploited by a less privileged users to inject Lua code that will execute at a later time, when a privileged user executes a Lua script. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used, is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.9,"exploitabilityScore":1.4,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-24735","epss":0.01946,"percentile":0.82578,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.2.7"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":1.3297666666666668},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:3.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"redis","version":"3.2.3"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-24735","versionConstraint":"< 6.2.7,= 7.0-rc1,= 7.0-rc2,= 7.0-rc3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.2.7"}}],"artifact":{"id":"fb1cb5db7ea72ac3","name":"redis","version":"3.2.3","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/redis-server","accessPath":"/bin/redis-server","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:3.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:3.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/redis@3.2.3","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-31449","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31449","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/1f7c148be2cbacf7d50aa461c58b871e87cc5ed9","https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-whxg-wx83-85p5"],"description":"Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk.

On 32-bit systems, Redis `*BIT*` command are vulnerable to integer overflow that can potentially be exploited to corrupt the heap, leak arbitrary heap contents or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted commands bit commands. This problem only affects Redis on 32-bit platforms, or compiled as a 32-bit binary. Redis versions 5.0.`3m 6.0.15, and 6.2.5 contain patches for this issue. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":6,"exploitabilityScore":6.9,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32761","epss":0.00528,"percentile":0.66226,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["5.0.13","6.0.15","6.2.5"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.3828},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:3.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"redis","version":"3.2.3"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2021-32761","versionConstraint":">= 2.2.0, < 5.0.13,>= 6.0, < 6.0.15,>= 6.2.0, < 6.2.5 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"5.0.13"}}],"artifact":{"id":"fb1cb5db7ea72ac3","name":"redis","version":"3.2.3","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/redis-server","accessPath":"/bin/redis-server","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:3.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:3.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/redis@3.2.3","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2016-10517","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10517","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101572","https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/874804da0c014a7d704b3d285aa500098a931f50","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/3.2/00-RELEASENOTES","https://www.reddit.com/r/redis/comments/5r8wxn/redis_327_is_out_important_security_fixes_inside/","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101572","https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/874804da0c014a7d704b3d285aa500098a931f50","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/3.2/00-RELEASENOTES","https://www.reddit.com/r/redis/comments/5r8wxn/redis_327_is_out_important_security_fixes_inside/"],"description":"networking.c in Redis before 3.2.7 allows \"Cross Protocol Scripting\" because it lacks a check for POST and Host: strings, which are not valid in the Redis protocol (but commonly occur when an attack triggers an HTTP request to the Redis TCP port).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.3,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2016-10517","epss":0.00526,"percentile":0.66097,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.2.7"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.351105},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:3.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"redis","version":"3.2.3"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2016-10517","versionConstraint":"< 3.2.7 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.2.7"}}],"artifact":{"id":"fb1cb5db7ea72ac3","name":"redis","version":"3.2.3","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/redis-server","accessPath":"/bin/redis-server","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:3.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:3.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/redis@3.2.3","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-3470","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3470","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1943623","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1943623"],"description":"A heap overflow issue was found in Redis in versions before 5.0.10, before 6.0.9 and before 6.2.0 when using a heap allocator other than jemalloc or glibc's malloc, leading to potential out of bound write or process crash.

For users unable to upgrade, it is possible to work around the problem by disabling Unix sockets, starting Redis with a restrictive umask, or storing the Unix socket file in a protected directory.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45145","epss":0.00445,"percentile":0.62531,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.2.14","7.0.14","7.2.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.14684999999999998},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:3.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"redis","version":"3.2.3"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45145","versionConstraint":">= 2.6.0, < 6.2.14,>= 7.0.0, < 7.0.14,>= 7.2.0, < 7.2.2,= 2.6.0-rc1 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.2.14"}}],"artifact":{"id":"fb1cb5db7ea72ac3","name":"redis","version":"3.2.3","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/redis-server","accessPath":"/bin/redis-server","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:3.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:3.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/redis@3.2.3","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-3734","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3734","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://vuldb.com/?id.212416","https://www.cnblogs.com/J0o1ey/p/16829380.html","https://vuldb.com/?id.212416","https://www.cnblogs.com/J0o1ey/p/16829380.html"],"description":"A vulnerability was found in a port or fork of Redis.

In versions starting at 2.6 and prior to 7.4.3, An unauthenticated client can cause unlimited growth of output buffers, until the server runs out of memory or is killed. By default, the Redis configuration does not limit the output buffer of normal clients (see client-output-buffer-limit). Therefore, the output buffer can grow unlimitedly over time. As a result, the service is exhausted and the memory is unavailable. When password authentication is enabled on the Redis server, but no password is provided, the client can still cause the output buffer to grow from \"NOAUTH\" responses until the system will run out of memory. This issue has been patched in version 7.4.3. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable is to block access to prevent unauthenticated users from connecting to Redis. This can be done in different ways.
