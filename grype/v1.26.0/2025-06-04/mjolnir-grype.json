buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.

The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including versions 1.0.1 and 2.2.1 does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse` should restrict parsing of `__proto__` keys when parsing JSON strings to objects. As a point of reference, the `JSON.parse` method included in JavaScript ignores `__proto__` keys. Simply changing `JSON5.parse` to `JSON.parse` in the examples above mitigates this vulnerability. This vulnerability is patched in json5 versions 1.0.2, 2.2.2, and later.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":5.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-46175","epss":0.41091,"percentile":0.97228,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"json5","version":"2.2.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=2.0.0,<2.2.2 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.2.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"abe58e44b5318eec","name":"json5","version":"2.2.1","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/node_modules/json5/package.json","accessPath":"/node_modules/json5/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:json5:json5:2.2.1:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/json5@2.2.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-32214","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32214","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://hackerone.com/reports/1524692","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/july-2022-security-releases/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5326","https://hackerone.com/reports/1524692","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/july-2022-security-releases/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5326"],"description":"The llhttp parser <v14.20.1, <v16.17.1 and <v18.9.1 in the http module in Node.js does not strictly use the CRLF sequence to delimit HTTP requests.

This is because it both defaults to SHA1, a cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure since at least 2005, and defaults to one single iteration, a 'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1,000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on iteration count as a countermeasure to preimage and collision attacks. If used to protect passwords, the impact is high. If used to generate signatures, the impact is high.

This vulnerability emerges during the repair operation, where the \"msiexec.exe\" process, running under the NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM context, attempts to read the %USERPROFILE% environment variable from the current user's registry.\n\nThe issue arises when the path referenced by the %USERPROFILE% environment variable does not exist. In such cases, the \"msiexec.exe\" process attempts to create the specified path in an unsafe manner, potentially leading to the creation of arbitrary folders in arbitrary locations.\n\nThe severity of this vulnerability is heightened by the fact that the %USERPROFILE% environment variable in the Windows registry can be modified by standard (or \"non-privileged\") users. Consequently, unprivileged actors, including malicious entities or trojans, can manipulate the environment variable key to deceive the privileged \"msiexec.exe\" process. This manipulation can result in the creation of folders in unintended and potentially malicious locations.\n\nIt is important to note that this vulnerability is specific to Windows users who install Node.js using the .msi installer.

NPM package `micromatch` prior to 4.0.8 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persists. This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to greedy matching.
