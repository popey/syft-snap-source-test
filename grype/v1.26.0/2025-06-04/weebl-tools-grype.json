Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information. This issue has been patched in version 2.31.0.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-32681","epss":0.04731,"percentile":0.88915,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"requests","version":"2.28.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=2.3.0,<2.31.0 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.31.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"862caf6ec7ecef4c","name":"requests","version":"2.28.1","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/requests-2.28.1.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/requests-2.28.1.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/requests-2.28.1.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/requests-2.28.1.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["Apache 2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:requests:2.28.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/requests@2.28.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-79v4-65xg-pq4g","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-79v4-65xg-pq4g","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"Vulnerable OpenSSL included in cryptography wheels","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-12797","epss":0.0013,"percentile":0.33811,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["44.0.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.039},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-12797","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-12797","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/738d4f9fdeaad57660dcba50a619fafced3fd5e9","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/798779d43494549b611233f92652f0da5328fbe7","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/87ebd203feffcf92ad5889df92f90bb0ee10a699","https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20250211.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/02/11/3","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/02/11/4","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250214-0001/"],"description":"Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a\nserver may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated, because\nhandshakes don't abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode\nis set.\n\nImpact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be\nvulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not\ndetected by clients.\n\nRPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The issue\nonly arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server, and the\nserver, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate\nchain.  The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to\nfail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys,\nby setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.\n\nClients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw\npublic key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result(), and those\nthat do, and take appropriate action, are not affected.
