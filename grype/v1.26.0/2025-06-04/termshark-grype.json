Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45288","epss":0.64852,"percentile":0.98352,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.21.9","1.22.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":48.638999999999996},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.17:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.17"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45288","versionConstraint":"<

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers.

This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected.

The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45337","epss":0.36067,"percentile":0.9691,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.0.0-20200622213623-75b288015ac9"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.31.0

If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21.

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20201224014010-6772e930b67b"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.17.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"fae3caec16fe2f49","name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20201224014010-6772e930b67b","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/termshark","accessPath":"/bin/termshark","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:networking:v0.0.0-20201224014010-6772e930b67b:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/net@v0.0.0-20201224014010-6772e930b67b","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.17","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:iFwSg7t5GZmB/Q5TjiEAsdoLDrdJRC1RiF2WhuV29Qw=","mainModule":"github.com/gcla/termshark/v2"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-41722","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41722","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/468123","https://go.dev/issue/57274","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1568","https://go.dev/cl/468123","https://go.dev/issue/57274","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1568"],"description":"A path traversal vulnerability exists in filepath.Clean on Windows.

form parsing can consume large amounts of CPU and memory when processing form inputs containing very large numbers of parts. This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In addition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts.

On Windows, a path beginning with \\??\\ is a Root Local Device path equivalent to a path beginning with \\\\?\\. Paths with a \\??\\ prefix may be used to access arbitrary locations on the system. For example, the path \\??\\c:\\x is equivalent to the more common path c:\\x. Before fix, Clean could convert a rooted path such as \\a\\..\\??\\b into the root local device path \\??\\b. Clean will now convert this to .\\??\\b. Similarly, Join(\\, ??, b) could convert a seemingly innocent sequence of path elements into the root local device path \\??\\b. Join will now convert this to \\.\\??\\b.

Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41725","epss":0.00051,"percentile":0.15979,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.6"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.038250000000000006},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.17:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.17"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-41725","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.6,= 1.20.0,= 1.20.0-rc1,= 1.20.0-rc2,= 1.20.0-rc3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.6"}}],"artifact":{"id":"da2a5b88319d99a2","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.17","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/termshark","accessPath":"/bin/termshark","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.17:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.17","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.17","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-hcg3-q754-cr77","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hcg3-q754-cr77","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"golang.org/x/crypto Vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) via Slow or Incomplete Key Exchange","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-22869","epss":0.00051,"percentile":0.15903,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.35.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.038250000000000006},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-22869","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22869","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/652135","https://go.dev/issue/71931","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3487","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250411-0010/"],"description":"SSH servers which implement file transfer protocols are vulnerable to a denial of service attack from clients which complete the key exchange slowly, or not at all, causing pending content to be read into memory, but never transmitted.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-22869","epss":0.00051,"percentile":0.15903,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.0.0-20200622213623-75b288015ac9"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.35.0 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-hcg3-q754-cr77"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.35.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"d8bed09936774f89","name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.0.0-20200622213623-75b288015ac9","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/termshark","accessPath":"/bin/termshark","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:go:ssh:v0.0.0-20200622213623-75b288015ac9:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/crypto@v0.0.0-20200622213623-75b288015ac9","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.17","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:psW17arqaxU48Z5kZ0CQnkZWQJsqcURM6tKiBApRjXI=","mainModule":"github.com/gcla/termshark/v2"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-29400","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29400","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/491617","https://go.dev/issue/59722","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/MEb0UyuSMsU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1753","https://go.dev/cl/491617","https://go.dev/issue/59722","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/MEb0UyuSMsU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1753","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241213-0005/"],"description":"Templates containing actions in unquoted HTML attributes (e.g. \"attr={{.}}\") executed with empty input can result in output with unexpected results when parsed due to HTML normalization rules.

The os.DirFS function and http.Dir type provide access to a tree of files rooted at a given directory. These functions permit access to Windows device files under that root. For example, os.DirFS(\"C:/tmp\").Open(\"COM1\") opens the COM1 device. Both os.DirFS and http.Dir only provide read-only filesystem access.
