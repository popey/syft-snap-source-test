A vulnerability in versions prior to `17.0.0-alpha.6`, `16.0.6`, `15.3.5`, `14.2.4`, and `13.6.6` allows renderers to obtain access to a bluetooth device via the web bluetooth API if the app has not configured a custom `select-bluetooth-device` event handler. This has been patched and Electron versions `17.0.0-alpha.6`, `16.0.6`, `15.3.5`, `14.2.4`, and `13.6.6` contain the fix. Code from the GitHub Security Advisory can be added to the app to work around the issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":3.2,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4,"exploitabilityScore":8,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.4,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-21718","epss":0.00398,"percentile":0.59812,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"electron","version":"1.8.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<13.6.6 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3p22-ghq8-v749"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"13.6.6"}}],"artifact":{"id":"705b2c403a046577","name":"electron","version":"1.8.2","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/node_modules/electron/package.json","accessPath":"/node_modules/electron/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:electronjs:electron:1.8.2:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/electron@1.8.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-6vrv-94jv-crrg","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6vrv-94jv-crrg","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"Context isolation bypass via Promise in Electron","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-15096","epss":0.00237,"percentile":0.47005,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.1.11"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.11613000000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2020-15096","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15096","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-6vrv-94jv-crrg","https://www.electronjs.org/releases/stable?page=3#release-notes-for-v824","https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-6vrv-94jv-crrg","https://www.electronjs.org/releases/stable?page=3#release-notes-for-v824"],"description":"In Electron before versions 6.1.1, 7.2.4, 8.2.4, and 9.0.0-beta21, there is a context isolation bypass, meaning that code running in the main world context in the renderer can reach into the isolated Electron context and perform privileged actions.

is an HTTP authentication scheme providing mechanisms for making authenticated HTTP requests with partial cryptographic verification of the request and response, covering the HTTP method, request URI, host, and optionally the request payload. Hawk used a regular expression to parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker's input increases the computation time exponentially. `parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead. `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host` and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-29167","epss":0.00092,"percentile":0.27258,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"hawk","version":"6.0.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<9.0.1 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-44pw-h2cw-w3vq"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"9.0.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"4b220c104f262e22","name":"hawk","version":"6.0.2","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/node_modules/hawk/package.json","accessPath":"/node_modules/hawk/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:hueniverse:hawk:6.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:hawk:hawk:6.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/hawk@6.0.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-77xc-hjv8-ww97","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-77xc-hjv8-ww97","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"AutoUpdater module fails to validate certain nested components of the bundle","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.6,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-29257","epss":0.00109,"percentile":0.30419,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["15.5.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.06322},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-29257","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29257","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-77xc-hjv8-ww97","https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-77xc-hjv8-ww97"],"description":"Electron is a framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript (JS), HTML, and CSS.
