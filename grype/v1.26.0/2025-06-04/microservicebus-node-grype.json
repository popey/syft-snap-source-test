This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.

BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-0778","epss":0.06917,"percentile":0.90942,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["17.7.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":4.755437499999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:14.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"14.3.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-0778","versionConstraint":">

still allows an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the

still allows an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the application.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-10160","epss":0.01722,"percentile":0.8154,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.7.17","3.5.8","3.6.9","3.7.4"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":1.4809200000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"3.5.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-10160","versionConstraint":">= 2.7.0, < 2.7.17,>= 3.5.0, < 3.5.8,>= 3.6.0, < 3.6.9,>= 3.7.0, < 3.7.4,= 3.8.0-alpha4,= 3.8.0-beta1 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.5.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"656e1da1323c4428","name":"python","version":"3.5.2","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.5m.so.1.0","accessPath":"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.5m.so.1.0","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:3.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@3.5.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-vx3p-948g-6vhq","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vx3p-948g-6vhq","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-27290","epss":0.01669,"percentile":0.81258,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.0.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":1.2517500000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2021-27290","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27290","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf","https://doyensec.com/resources/Doyensec_Advisory_ssri_redos.pdf","https://github.com/yetingli/SaveResults/blob/main/pdf/ssri-redos.pdf","https://npmjs.com","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html","https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf","https://doyensec.com/resources/Doyensec_Advisory_ssri_redos.pdf","https://github.com/yetingli/SaveResults/blob/main/pdf/ssri-redos.pdf","https://npmjs.com","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"],"description":"ssri 5.2.2-8.0.0, fixed in 8.0.1, processes SRIs using a regular expression which is vulnerable to a denial of service.

This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9.

This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does.

nghttp2 before version 1.41.0, the overly large HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame payload causes denial of service. The proof of concept attack involves a malicious client constructing a SETTINGS frame with a length of 14,400 bytes (2400 individual settings entries) over and over again. The attack causes the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2 v1.41.0 fixes this vulnerability. There is a workaround to this vulnerability. Implement nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback, and if received frame is SETTINGS frame and the number of settings entries are large (e.g., > 32), then drop the connection.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":3.7,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-11080","epss":0.00741,"percentile":0.71894,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":""},"advisories":[],"risk":0.477945},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:14.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"14.3.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-11080","versionConstraint":">= 10.0.0, <= 10.12.0,>= 12.0.0, <= 12.12.0,>= 14.0.0, <= 14.4.0 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*"]}}],"artifact":{"id":"6ef231b45a730224","name":"node","version":"14.3.0","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/node","accessPath":"/bin/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:14.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/node@14.3.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2017-17522","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17522","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102207","https://bugs.python.org/issue32367","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17522","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102207","https://bugs.python.org/issue32367","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17522"],"description":"Lib/webbrowser.py in Python through 3.6.3 does not validate strings before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL.

An attack may be the same as in CVE-2019-11340; however, this CVE applies to Python more generally.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-16056","epss":0.00625,"percentile":0.69202,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":""},"advisories":[],"risk":0.42968750000000006},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"3.5.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-16056","versionConstraint":"<= 2.7.16,>= 3.0.0, <= 3.0.1,>= 3.1.0, <= 3.1.5,>= 3.2.0, <= 3.2.6,>= 3.3.0, <= 3.3.7,>= 3.4.0, <= 3.4.10,>= 3.5.0, <= 3.5.7,>= 3.6.0, <= 3.6.9,>= 3.7.0, <= 3.7.4 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}}],"artifact":{"id":"656e1da1323c4428","name":"python","version":"3.5.2","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.5m.so.1.0","accessPath":"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.5m.so.1.0","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:3.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@3.5.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-4032","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-4032","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/17/3","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/22adf29da8d99933ffed8647d3e0726edd16f7f8","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/40d75c2b7f5c67e254d0a025e0f2e2c7ada7f69f","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/895f7e2ac23eff4743143beef0f0c5ac71ea27d3","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/ba431579efdcbaed7a96f2ac4ea0775879a332fb","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/c62c9e518b784fe44432a3f4fc265fb95b651906","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/f86b17ac511e68192ba71f27e752321a3252cee3","https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113171","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/113179","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/NRUHDUS2IV2USIZM2CVMSFL6SCKU3RZA/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240726-0004/","https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml","https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry/iana-ipv6-special-registry.xhtml","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/17/3","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/22adf29da8d99933ffed8647d3e0726edd16f7f8","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/40d75c2b7f5c67e254d0a025e0f2e2c7ada7f69f","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/895f7e2ac23eff4743143beef0f0c5ac71ea27d3","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/ba431579efdcbaed7a96f2ac4ea0775879a332fb","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/c62c9e518b784fe44432a3f4fc265fb95b651906","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/f86b17ac511e68192ba71f27e752321a3252cee3","https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113171","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/113179","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/NRUHDUS2IV2USIZM2CVMSFL6SCKU3RZA/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240726-0004/","https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml","https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry/iana-ipv6-special-registry.xhtml"],"description":"The “ipaddress” module contained incorrect information about whether certain IPv4 and IPv6 addresses were designated as “globally reachable” or “private”.

X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a \"purpose\" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named \"purpose\" values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected 1.1.1h-1.1.1j).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-3450","epss":0.00441,"percentile":0.62313,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["10.24.1","12.22.1","14.16.1","15.14.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.310905},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:14.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"14.3.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2021-3450","versionConstraint":">= 10.0.0, < 10.24.1,>= 12.0.0, < 12.22.1,>= 14.0.0, < 14.16.1,>= 15.0.0, < 15.14.0 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"14.16.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"6ef231b45a730224","name":"node","version":"14.3.0","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/node","accessPath":"/bin/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:14.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/node@14.3.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-0397","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0397","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/17/2","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/01c37f1d0714f5822d34063ca7180b595abf589d","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/29c97287d205bf2f410f4895ebce3f43b5160524","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/37324b421b72b7bc9934e27aba85d48d4773002e","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/542f3272f56f31ed04e74c40635a913fbc12d286","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/b228655c227b2ca298a8ffac44d14ce3d22f6faa","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/bce693111bff906ccf9281c22371331aaff766ab","https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114572","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/114573","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/BMAK5BCGKYWNJOACVUSLUF6SFGBIM4VP/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/17/2","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/01c37f1d0714f5822d34063ca7180b595abf589d","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/29c97287d205bf2f410f4895ebce3f43b5160524","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/37324b421b72b7bc9934e27aba85d48d4773002e","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/542f3272f56f31ed04e74c40635a913fbc12d286","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/b228655c227b2ca298a8ffac44d14ce3d22f6faa","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/bce693111bff906ccf9281c22371331aaff766ab","https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114572","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/114573","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/BMAK5BCGKYWNJOACVUSLUF6SFGBIM4VP/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250411-0006/"],"description":"A defect was discovered in the Python “ssl” module where there is a memory\nrace condition with the ssl.SSLContext methods “cert_store_stats()” and\n“get_ca_certs()”.

Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":3.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":3.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2018-1000030","epss":0.00774,"percentile":0.72559,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":""},"advisories":[],"risk":0.25155},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"2.7.12"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-1000030","versionConstraint":"<= 2.7.14 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}}],"artifact":{"id":"74dc27ec36c075ab","name":"python","version":"2.7.12","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/python2.7","accessPath":"/usr/bin/python2.7","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@2.7.12","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-22884","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22884","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf","https://hackerone.com/reports/1069487","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/E4FRS5ZVK4ZQ7XIJQNGIKUXG2DJFHLO7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F45Y7TXSU33MTKB6AGL2Q5V5ZOCNPKOG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HSYFUGKFUSZ27M5TEZ3FKILWTWFJTFAZ/","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/february-2021-security-releases/","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/march-2018-security-releases/#node-js-inspector-dns-rebinding-vulnerability-cve-2018-7160","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210416-0001/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210723-0001/","https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html","https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf","https://hackerone.com/reports/1069487","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/E4FRS5ZVK4ZQ7XIJQNGIKUXG2DJFHLO7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F45Y7TXSU33MTKB6AGL2Q5V5ZOCNPKOG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HSYFUGKFUSZ27M5TEZ3FKILWTWFJTFAZ/","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/february-2021-security-releases/","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/march-2018-security-releases/#node-js-inspector-dns-rebinding-vulnerability-cve-2018-7160","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210416-0001/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210723-0001/","https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"],"description":"Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks as the whitelist includes “localhost6”.

This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32803","epss":0.00208,"percentile":0.43703,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"6.0.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=6.0.0,<6.1.2 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.1.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"884160ba0968604e","name":"tar","version":"6.0.2","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/microservicebus-node/node_modules/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/microservicebus-node/node_modules/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:6.0.2:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@6.0.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-36138","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36138","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/july-2024-security-releases","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241108-0010/"],"description":"Bypass incomplete fix of CVE-2024-27980, that arises from improper handling of batch files with all possible extensions on Windows via child_process.spawn / child_process.spawnSync.

X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.3,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-1971","epss":0.00264,"percentile":0.49787,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["15.5.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.13332000000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:14.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"14.3.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-1971","versionConstraint":">=

issue was discovered in Python before 3.11.1. An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-45061","epss":0.0008,"percentile":0.24664,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.7.16","3.8.16","3.9.16","3.10.9","3.11.1","3.12.0a3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.060000000000000005},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"2.7.12"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-45061","versionConstraint":"<

An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302.

This behavior can be reverted through the --security-revert command-line option.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-44531","epss":0.0005,"percentile":0.15567,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["12.22.9","14.18.3","16.13.2","17.3.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.035250000000000004},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:14.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"14.3.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2021-44531","versionConstraint":"< 12.22.9,>= 14.0.0, < 14.18.3,>= 16.0.0, < 16.13.2,>= 17.0.0, < 17.3.1 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"14.18.3"}}],"artifact":{"id":"6ef231b45a730224","name":"node","version":"14.3.0","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/node","accessPath":"/bin/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:14.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/node@14.3.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-48566","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-48566","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://bugs.python.org/issue40791","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00022.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00017.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0013/","https://bugs.python.org/issue40791","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00022.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00017.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0013/"],"description":"An issue was discovered in compare_digest in Lib/hmac.py in Python through 3.9.1.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit. A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit. A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues.

The fix adds support for Unix “700” for the mkdir function on Windows which is used by mkdtemp() to ensure the newly created directory has the proper permissions.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4030","epss":0.00014,"percentile":0.01528,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.8.20","3.9.20","3.10.15","3.11.10","3.12.4","3.13.0b1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.01022},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"3.5.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-4030","versionConstraint":"< 3.8.20,>= 3.10.0, < 3.10.15,>= 3.11.0, < 3.11.10,>= 3.12.0, < 3.12.4,>= 3.13.0a1, < 3.13.0b1,>= 3.9.0, < 3.9.20 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.8.20"}}],"artifact":{"id":"656e1da1323c4428","name":"python","version":"3.5.2","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.5m.so.1.0","accessPath":"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.5m.so.1.0","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:3.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@3.5.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-4516","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4516","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/4398b788ffc1f954a2c552da285477d42a571292","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/6279eb8c076d89d3739a6edb393e43c7929b429d","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/69b4387f78f413e8c47572a85b3478c47eba8142","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/73b3040f592436385007918887b7e2132aa8431f","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/8d35fd1b34935221aff23a1ab69a429dd156be77","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/9f69a58623bd01349a18ba0c7a9cb1dad6a51e8e","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/ab9893c40609935e0d40a6d2a7307ea51aec598b","https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/133767","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/129648","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/L75IPBBTSCYEF56I2M4KIW353BB3AY74/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/05/16/4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/05/19/1"],"description":"There is an issue in CPython when using `bytes.decode(\"unicode_escape\", error=\"ignore|replace\")`.
