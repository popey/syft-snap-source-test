This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which fixes a similar bug in later versions of tar.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32804","epss":0.87712,"percentile":0.99436,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"2.2.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<3.2.2 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3jfq-g458-7qm9"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.2.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"7aa53e4d8a8d416f","name":"tar","version":"2.2.2","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/resources/app/node_modules/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/resources/app/node_modules/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:2.2.2:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@2.2.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qppj-fm5r-hxr3","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"HTTP/2 Stream Cancellation Attack","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"knownExploited":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-44487","vendorProject":"IETF","product":"HTTP/2","dateAdded":"2023-10-10","requiredAction":"Apply mitigations per vendor instructions, follow applicable BOD 22-01 guidance for cloud services, or discontinue use of the product if mitigations are unavailable.","dueDate":"2023-10-31","knownRansomwareCampaignUse":"unknown","notes":"This vulnerability affects a common open-source component, third-party library, or protocol used by different products.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed.

The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including versions 1.0.1 and 2.2.1 does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse` should restrict parsing of `__proto__` keys when parsing JSON strings to objects. As a point of reference, the `JSON.parse` method included in JavaScript ignores `__proto__` keys. Simply changing `JSON5.parse` to `JSON.parse` in the examples above mitigates this vulnerability.

npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-37713","epss":0.00938,"percentile":0.75192,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"2.2.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<4.4.18

As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-21681","epss":0.00458,"percentile":0.63112,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"marked","version":"0.5.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<4.0.10 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-5v2h-r2cx-5xgj"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"4.0.10"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a38fe8ede82130c9","name":"marked","version":"0.5.2","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/resources/app/node_modules/marked/package.json","accessPath":"/resources/app/node_modules/marked/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:marked_project:marked:0.5.2:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/marked@0.5.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-2p57-rm9w-gvfp","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2p57-rm9w-gvfp","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"ip SSRF improper categorization in isPublic","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-29415","epss":0.00438,"percentile":0.62199,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.34164000000000005},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-29415","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29415","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/issues/150","https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/143","https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/144","https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/issues/150","https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/143","https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/144","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250117-0010/"],"description":"The ip package through 2.0.1 for Node.js might allow SSRF because some IP addresses (such as 127.1, 01200034567, 012.1.2.3, 000:0:0000::01, and ::fFFf:127.0.0.1) are improperly categorized as globally routable via isPublic.

The file `packages/electron-updater/src/windowsExecutableCodeSignatureVerifier.ts` implements the signature validation routine for Electron applications on Windows.

This creates a situation where `verifySignature()` can be tricked into validating the certificate of a different file than the one that was just downloaded.

There are no known workarounds for this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39533","epss":0.0011,"percentile":0.3061,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p","version":"v0.9.6"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.27.8 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-876p-8259-xjgg"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.27.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"8677f372b1ebbbf7","name":"github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p","version":"v0.9.6","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/resources/app/build/bin/hive_linux_amd64","accessPath":"/resources/app/build/bin/hive_linux_amd64","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:protocol:libp2p:v0.9.6:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p@v0.9.6","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.14.4","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:sDiuVhuLpWQOjSFmxOJEXVM9RHKIUTKgi8ArSS9nBtE=","mainModule":"github.com/StreamSpace/ss-curator-cli"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-cfm4-qjh2-4765","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cfm4-qjh2-4765","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature in node-forge","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-24771","epss":0.00106,"percentile":0.29831,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.3.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.07949999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-24771","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24771","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/3f0b49a0573ef1bb7af7f5673c0cfebf00424df1","https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/security/advisories/GHSA-cfm4-qjh2-4765","https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/3f0b49a0573ef1bb7af7f5673c0cfebf00424df1","https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/security/advisories/GHSA-cfm4-qjh2-4765"],"description":"Forge (also called `node-forge`) is a native implementation of Transport Layer Security in JavaScript.

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20200519113804-d87ec0cfa476"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20200519113804-d87ec0cfa476"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.17.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"4075774357a358a0","name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20200519113804-d87ec0cfa476","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/resources/app/build/bin/hive_linux_amd64","accessPath":"/resources/app/build/bin/hive_linux_amd64","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:networking:v0.0.0-20200519113804-d87ec0cfa476:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/net@v0.0.0-20200519113804-d87ec0cfa476","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.14.4","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:E7ct1C6/33eOdrGZKMoyntcEvs2dwZnDe30crG5vpYU=","mainModule":"github.com/StreamSpace/ss-curator-cli"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-41722","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41722","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/468123","https://go.dev/issue/57274","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1568","https://go.dev/cl/468123","https://go.dev/issue/57274","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1568"],"description":"A path traversal vulnerability exists in filepath.Clean on Windows.

and MIME header parsing can allocate large amounts of memory, even when parsing small inputs, potentially leading to a denial of service.

malicious HTTP sender can use chunk extensions to cause a receiver reading from a request or response body to read many more bytes from the network than are in the body. A malicious HTTP client can further exploit this to cause a server to automatically read a large amount of data (up to about 1GiB) when a handler fails to read the entire body of a request.

When using versions of Babel prior to 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17 to compile regular expression named capturing groups, Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`). Generated code is vulnerable if all the following conditions are true: Using Babel to compile regular expression named capturing groups, using the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups, and the code using untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`. This problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17. It's likely that individual users do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees use of a new enough `@babel/helpers` version. Note that just updating Babel dependencies is not enough; one will also need to re-compile the code. No known workarounds are available.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.2,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27789","epss":0.0002,"percentile":0.03802,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"@babel/runtime","version":"7.9.6"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<7.26.10

Similarly, if a setuid/setgid program is terminated, either via panic or signal, it may leak the contents of its registers.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-29403","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00444,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.10","1.20.5"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.006120000000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.14.4:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.14.4"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-29403","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.10,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.5 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.10"}}],"artifact":{"id":"bffded86c487a1de","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.14.4","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/resources/app/build/bin/hive_linux_amd64","accessPath":"/resources/app/build/bin/hive_linux_amd64","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.14.4:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.14.4","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.14.4","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-qxp5-gwg8-xv66","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qxp5-gwg8-xv66","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"HTTP Proxy bypass using IPv6 Zone IDs in golang.org/x/net","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-22870","epss":0.00012,"percentile":0.01245,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.36.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.00564},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-22870","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22870","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/654697","https://go.dev/issue/71984","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3503","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/07/2","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250509-0007/"],"description":"Matching of hosts against proxy patterns can improperly treat an IPv6 zone ID as a hostname component.
