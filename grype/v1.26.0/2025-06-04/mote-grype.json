This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.

It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a \"purpose\" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named \"purpose\" values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.

This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32803","epss":0.00208,"percentile":0.43703,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"6.1.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=6.0.0,<6.1.2 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.1.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"0ae4ef1d2165dc0e","name":"tar","version":"6.1.0","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/node-gyp/node_modules/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/node-gyp/node_modules/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:6.1.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@6.1.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-36138","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36138","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/july-2024-security-releases","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241108-0010/"],"description":"Bypass incomplete fix of CVE-2024-27980, that arises from improper handling of batch files with all possible extensions on Windows via child_process.spawn / child_process.spawnSync.

X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.3,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-1971","epss":0.00264,"percentile":0.49787,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["10.23.1","12.20.1","14.15.4"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.13332000000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:10.21.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"10.21.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-1971","versionConstraint":">= 10.13.0, < 10.23.1,>= 12.13.0, < 12.20.1,>= 14.15.0, < 14.15.4 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"10.23.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"fdd38b58ccfbbc70","name":"node","version":"10.21.0","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/node","accessPath":"/bin/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:10.21.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/node@10.21.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-44533","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44533","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://hackerone.com/reports/1429694","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/jan-2022-security-releases/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220325-0007/","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5170","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html","https://hackerone.com/reports/1429694","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/jan-2022-security-releases/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220325-0007/","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5170","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"],"description":"Node.js < 12.22.9, < 14.18.3, < 16.13.2, and < 17.3.1 did not handle multi-value Relative Distinguished Names correctly.
