In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways: 1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the --max-http-header-size=size and/or the maxHeaderSize options so that no more headers than the server.maxHeadersCount limit can be sent. 2. Set server.maxHeadersCount to 0 so that no limit is applied.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37890","epss":0.0032,"percentile":0.54571,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"ws","version":"8.16.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=8.0.0,<8.17.1 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"8.17.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"3d6b6711cb0a23a8","name":"ws","version":"8.16.0","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/resources/app/node_modules/ws/package.json","accessPath":"/resources/app/node_modules/ws/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:ws_project:ws:8.16.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/ws@8.16.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-9jxc-qjr9-vjxq","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9jxc-qjr9-vjxq","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"electron-updater Code Signing Bypass on Windows","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-39698","epss":0.00166,"percentile":0.38806,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.3.0-alpha.6"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.1245},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-39698","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39698","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/blob/140e2f0eb0df79c2a46e35024e96d0563355fc89/packages/electron-updater/src/windowsExecutableCodeSignatureVerifier.ts#L35-L41","https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/commit/ac2e6a25aa491c1ef5167a552c19fc2085cd427f","https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/pull/8295","https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/security/advisories/GHSA-9jxc-qjr9-vjxq","https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/blob/140e2f0eb0df79c2a46e35024e96d0563355fc89/packages/electron-updater/src/windowsExecutableCodeSignatureVerifier.ts#L35-L41","https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/commit/ac2e6a25aa491c1ef5167a552c19fc2085cd427f","https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/pull/8295","https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/security/advisories/GHSA-9jxc-qjr9-vjxq"],"description":"electron-updater allows for automatic updates for Electron apps.
