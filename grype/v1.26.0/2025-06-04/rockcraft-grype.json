SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers.

The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45337","epss":0.36067,"percentile":0.9691,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.0.0-20200604202706-70a84ac30bf9"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.31.0 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v778-237x-gjrc"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.31.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"f25bee603cfe13ca","name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.0.0-20200604202706-70a84ac30bf9","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/umoci","accessPath":"/bin/umoci","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:go:ssh:v0.0.0-20200604202706-70a84ac30bf9:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/crypto@v0.0.0-20200604202706-70a84ac30bf9","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.24.2","architecture":"amd64","mainModule":"github.com/opencontainers/umoci"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-c3xm-pvg7-gh7r","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c3xm-pvg7-gh7r","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"mount destinations can be swapped via symlink-exchange to cause mounts outside the rootfs","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.6,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-30465","epss":0.02358,"percentile":0.84173,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.0.0-rc95"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":1.78029},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2021-30465","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-30465","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/19/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/19/2","https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1185405","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/0ca91f44f1664da834bc61115a849b56d22f595f","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-c3xm-pvg7-gh7r","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/03/msg00023.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/35ZW6NBZSBH5PWIT7JU4HXOXGFVDCOHH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4HOARVIT47RULTTFWAU7XBG4WY6TDDHV/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-26","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210708-0003/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/19/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/19/2","https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1185405","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/0ca91f44f1664da834bc61115a849b56d22f595f","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-c3xm-pvg7-gh7r","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/03/msg00023.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/35ZW6NBZSBH5PWIT7JU4HXOXGFVDCOHH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4HOARVIT47RULTTFWAU7XBG4WY6TDDHV/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-26","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210708-0003/"],"description":"runc before 1.0.0-rc95 allows a Container Filesystem Breakout via Directory Traversal.

In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":6,"exploitabilityScore":6.9,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":6,"exploitabilityScore":1.8,"impactScore":3.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-43784","epss":0.0013,"percentile":0.33887,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.0.0-rc90"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.0.3 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v95c-p5hm-xq8f"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.0.3"}}],"artifact":{"id":"5c80eb44e4231e9d","name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.0.0-rc90","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/umoci","accessPath":"/bin/umoci","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:opencontainers:runc:v1.0.0-rc90:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/opencontainers/runc@v1.0.0-rc90","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.24.2","architecture":"amd64","mainModule":"github.com/opencontainers/umoci"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-f3fp-gc8g-vw66","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f3fp-gc8g-vw66","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Default inheritable capabilities for linux container should be empty","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-29162","epss":0.00118,"percentile":0.31951,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.1.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.06431},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-29162","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29162","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/d04de3a9b72d7a2455c1885fc75eb36d02cd17b5","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.2","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-f3fp-gc8g-vw66","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/03/msg00023.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AVPZBV7ISA7QKRPTC7ZXWKMIQI2HZEBB/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/D77CKD3AXPMU4PMQIQI5Q74SI4JATNND/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GPQU4YC4AAY54JDXGDQHJEYKSXXG5T2Y/","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/d04de3a9b72d7a2455c1885fc75eb36d02cd17b5","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.2","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-f3fp-gc8g-vw66","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/03/msg00023.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AVPZBV7ISA7QKRPTC7ZXWKMIQI2HZEBB/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/D77CKD3AXPMU4PMQIQI5Q74SI4JATNND/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GPQU4YC4AAY54JDXGDQHJEYKSXXG5T2Y/"],"description":"runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification.

While this could be used to create empty files, existing files would not be truncated. An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom volume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but the scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced. Sufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block this attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict this attack's scope but the exact scope of protection hasn't been analysed. This is exploitable using runc directly as well as through Docker and Kubernetes. The issue is fixed in runc v1.1.14 and v1.2.0-rc3.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Using user namespaces restricts this attack fairly significantly such that the attacker can only create inodes in directories that the remapped root user/group has write access to. Unless the root user is remapped to an actual\nuser on the host (such as with rootless containers that don't use `/etc/sub[ug]id`), this in practice means that an attacker would only be able to create inodes in world-writable directories. A strict enough SELinux or AppArmor policy could in principle also restrict the scope if a specific label is applied to the runc runtime, though neither the extent to which the standard existing policies block this attack nor what exact policies are needed to sufficiently restrict this attack have been thoroughly tested.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45310","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00455,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.0.0-rc90"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.1.14
