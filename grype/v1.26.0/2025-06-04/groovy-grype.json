Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are

is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability where the processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects.

An attacker can manipulate the processed input stream and replace or inject objects, that result in the deletion of a file on the local host.

In affected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to allocate 100% CPU time on the target system depending on CPU type or parallel execution of such a payload resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.8,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:C","metrics":{"baseScore":6.3,"exploitabilityScore":6.9,"impactScore":6.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-39140","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26738,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"xstream","version":"1.4.12"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.4.18 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-6wf9-jmg9-vxcc"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.4.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"c3900d4ed8850f41","name":"xstream","version":"1.4.12","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/lib/xstream-1.4.12.jar","accessPath":"/lib/xstream-1.4.12.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:com.thoughtworks.xstream:xstream:1.4.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:thoughtworks:xstream:1.4.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:xstream:xstream:1.4.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/com.thoughtworks.xstream/xstream@1.4.12","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/lib/xstream-1.4.12.jar","pomArtifactID":"xstream","pomGroupID":"com.thoughtworks.xstream","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"a668a33eb8d7c3ac728a3823cf4339ff762c75ca"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-w37g-rhq8-7m4j","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w37g-rhq8-7m4j","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Snakeyaml vulnerable to Stack overflow leading to denial of service","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41854","epss":0.00076,"percentile":0.23837,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.32"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0437},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-41854","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41854","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=50355","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3DDXEXXWAZGF5AVHIPGFPXIWL6TSMKJE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7MKE4XWRXTH32757H7QJU4ACS67DYDCR/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KSPAJ5Y45A4ZDION2KN5RDWLHK4XKY2J/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240315-0009/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/","https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=50355","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3DDXEXXWAZGF5AVHIPGFPXIWL6TSMKJE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7MKE4XWRXTH32757H7QJU4ACS67DYDCR/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KSPAJ5Y45A4ZDION2KN5RDWLHK4XKY2J/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240315-0009/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/"],"description":"Those using Snakeyaml to parse untrusted YAML files may be vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks (DOS).

JUnit4 from version 4.7 and before 4.13.1, the test rule TemporaryFolder contains a local information disclosure vulnerability. On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system. This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability. This vulnerability impacts you if the JUnit tests write sensitive information, like API keys or passwords, into the temporary folder, and the JUnit tests execute in an environment where the OS has other untrusted users. Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you are using. For Java 1.7 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed in 4.13.1. For Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is available, you must use the workaround below. If you are unable to patch, or are stuck running on Java 1.6, specifying the `java.io.tmpdir` system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will fix this vulnerability. For more information, including an example of vulnerable code, see the referenced GitHub Security Advisory.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":1.9,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-15250","epss":0.00018,"percentile":0.03029,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"junit","version":"4.13"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=4.7,<4.13.1
