Declare a class that derives from `MessagePackSecurity`.\n2. Override the `GetHashCollisionResistantEqualityComparer<T>` method to provide a collision-resistant hash function of your own and avoid calling `base.GetHashCollisionResistantEqualityComparer<T>()`.\n3. Configure a `MessagePackSerializerOptions` with an instance of your derived type by calling `WithSecurity` on an existing options object.\n4. Use your custom options object for all deserialization operations. This may be by setting the `MessagePackSerializer.DefaultOptions` static property, if you call methods that rely on this default property, and/or by passing in the options object explicitly to any `Deserialize` method.\n\n### References\n\n- Learn more about best security practices when reading untrusted data with [MessagePack 1.x](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/tree/v1.x#security) or [MessagePack 2.x](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp#security).\n- The .NET team's [discussion on hash collision vulnerabilities of their `HashCode` struct](https://github.com/GrabYourPitchforks/runtime/blob/threat_models/docs/design/security/System.HashCode.md).\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* [Start a public discussion](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/discussions)\n* [Email us privately](mailto:andrewarnott@live.com)","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":8.7},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-48924","epss":0.00069,"percentile":0.21821,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dotnet-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"dotnet","namespace":"github:language:dotnet","package":{"name":"MessagePack","version":"2.5.108"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<2.5.187 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4qm4-8hg2-g2xm"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.5.187"}}],"artifact":{"id":"340c95fd98f0db20","name":"MessagePack","version":"2.5.108","type":"dotnet","locations":[{"path":"/resources/app/ServiceHub/Controllers/microsoft-servicehub-controller/Microsoft.ServiceHub.Controller.deps.json","accessPath":"/resources/app/ServiceHub/Controllers/microsoft-servicehub-controller/Microsoft.ServiceHub.Controller.deps.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/resources/app/ServiceHub/Controllers/microsoft-servicehub-controller/MessagePack.dll","accessPath":"/resources/app/ServiceHub/Controllers/microsoft-servicehub-controller/MessagePack.dll","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"dotnet","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:neuecc,aarnott:messagepack_.net:2.5.108:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:messagepack:messagepack_.net:2.5.108:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:neuecc,aarnott:messagepack:2.5.108:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:messagepack:messagepack:2.5.108:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:nuget/MessagePack@2.5.108","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-4qm4-8hg2-g2xm","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4qm4-8hg2-g2xm","namespace":"github:language:dotnet","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"MessagePack allows untrusted data to lead to DoS attack due to hash collisions and stack overflow","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-48924","epss":0.00069,"percentile":0.21821,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.5.187"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.034499999999999996},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-48924","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-48924","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/commit/8e599af0798b45008f8b293a7f233e4878f11ed5","https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/commit/f8d40b3ad0be01c6e56cb51ecea81f59d98c192d","https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-4qm4-8hg2-g2xm"],"description":"### Impact\n\nWhen this library is used to deserialize messagepack data from an untrusted source, there is a risk of a denial of service attack by an attacker that sends data contrived to produce hash collisions, leading to large CPU consumption disproportionate to the size of the data being deserialized.\n\nThis is similar to [a prior advisory](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf), which provided an inadequate fix for the hash collision part of the vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe following steps are required to mitigate this risk.\n\n1.
