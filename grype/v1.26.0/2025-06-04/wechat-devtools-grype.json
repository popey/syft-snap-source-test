The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including versions 1.0.1 and 2.2.1 does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`.

BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m).

This vulnerability emerges during the repair operation, where the \"msiexec.exe\" process, running under the NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM context, attempts to read the %USERPROFILE% environment variable from the current user's registry.\n\nThe issue arises when the path referenced by the %USERPROFILE% environment variable does not exist. In such cases, the \"msiexec.exe\" process attempts to create the specified path in an unsafe manner, potentially leading to the creation of arbitrary folders in arbitrary locations.\n\nThe severity of this vulnerability is heightened by the fact that the %USERPROFILE% environment variable in the Windows registry can be modified by standard (or \"non-privileged\") users. Consequently, unprivileged actors, including malicious entities or trojans, can manipulate the environment variable key to deceive the privileged \"msiexec.exe\" process. This manipulation can result in the creation of folders in unintended and potentially malicious locations.\n\nIt is important to note that this vulnerability is specific to Windows users who install Node.js using the .msi installer.

However, the documentation says this API call: \"Generates private and public Diffie-Hellman key values\".\n\nThe documented behavior is very different from the actual behavior, and this difference could easily lead to security issues in applications that use these APIs as the DiffieHellman may be used as the basis for application-level security, implications are consequently broad.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-30590","epss":0.00497,"percentile":0.64832,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["16.20.1","18.16.1","20.3.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.37274999999999997},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:16.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"16.4.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-30590","versionConstraint":">= 16.0.0, < 16.20.1,>= 18.0.0, < 18.16.1,>= 20.0.0, < 20.3.1 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"16.20.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"e8d59ad02808770a","name":"node","version":"16.4.2","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/nwjs/node","accessPath":"/nwjs/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:16.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/node@16.4.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-46809","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46809","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/february-2024-security-releases"],"description":"Node.js versions which bundle an unpatched version of OpenSSL or run against a dynamically linked version of OpenSSL which are unpatched are vulnerable to the Marvin Attack - https://people.redhat.com/~hkario/marvin/, if PCKS #1 v1.5 padding is allowed when performing RSA descryption using a private key.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-46809","epss":0.0046,"percentile":0.63194,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["18.19.1","20.11.1","21.6.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.3427},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:16.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"16.4.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-46809","versionConstraint":"< 18.19.1,>= 19, < 20.11.1,>= 21, < 21.6.1 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"18.19.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"e8d59ad02808770a","name":"node","version":"16.4.2","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/nwjs/node","accessPath":"/nwjs/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:16.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/node@16.4.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-2p57-rm9w-gvfp","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2p57-rm9w-gvfp","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"ip SSRF improper categorization in isPublic","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-29415","epss":0.00438,"percentile":0.62199,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.34164000000000005},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-29415","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29415","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/issues/150","https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/143","https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/144","https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/issues/150","https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/143","https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/144","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250117-0010/"],"description":"The ip package through 2.0.1 for Node.js might allow SSRF because some IP addresses (such as 127.1, 01200034567, 012.1.2.3, 000:0:0000::01, and ::fFFf:127.0.0.1) are improperly categorized as globally routable via isPublic.

A request with a number of headers exceeding theserver.maxHeadersCount threshold could be used to crash a ws server. The vulnerability was fixed in ws@8.17.1 (e55e510) and backported to ws@7.5.10 (22c2876), ws@6.2.3 (eeb76d3), and ws@5.2.4 (4abd8f6).

Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own.
