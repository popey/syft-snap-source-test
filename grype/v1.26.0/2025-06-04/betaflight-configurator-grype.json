is a compiler for writing next generation JavaScript. When using versions of Babel prior to 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17 to compile regular expression named capturing groups, Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`). Generated code is vulnerable if all the following conditions are true: Using Babel to compile regular expression named capturing groups, using the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups, and the code using untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`. This problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17. It's likely that individual users do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees use of a new enough `@babel/helpers` version. Note that just updating Babel dependencies is not enough; one will also need to re-compile the code. No known workarounds are available.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.2,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27789","epss":0.0002,"percentile":0.03802,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"@babel/runtime","version":"7.6.3"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<7.26.10
