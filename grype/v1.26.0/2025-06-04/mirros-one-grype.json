Versions prior to 0.36.1, as well as those prior to 1.2.10 when used with the Ruby data source tzinfo-data, are vulnerable to relative path traversal. With the Ruby data source, time zones are defined in Ruby files. There is one file per time zone. Time zone files are loaded with `require` on demand. In the affected versions, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` fails to validate time zone identifiers correctly, allowing a new line character within the identifier. With Ruby version 1.9.3 and later, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` can be made to load unintended files with `require`, executing them within the Ruby process. Versions 0.3.61 and 1.2.10 include fixes to correctly validate time zone identifiers. Versions 2.0.0 and later are not vulnerable. Version 0.3.61 can still load arbitrary files from the Ruby load path if their name follows the rules for a valid time zone identifier and the file has a prefix of `tzinfo/definition` within a directory in the load path.

an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL_shutdown() twice (once to send a close_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable \"non-stitched\" ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway).

https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-action-viewOr it may be done with a `:tags` option to the Action View helper `sanitize`:```<%= sanitize @comment.body, tags: [\"select\", \"style\"] %>```see https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper.html#method-i-sanitizeOr it may be done with Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer directly:```ruby# class-level

In `bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted and apparently harmless `Gemfile`'s, it is not expected that they lead to execution of external code, unless that's explicit in the ruby code inside the `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile` includes `gem` entries that use the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly harmless, values with a leading dash, this can be false. To handle dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Bundler uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Bundler versions before 2.2.33 correctly avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. Since this value comes from the `Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a directory containing a `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Git repository. This dependency has to have a Git URL in the form of `-u./payload`. This URL will be used to construct a Git clone command but will be interpreted as the upload-pack argument. Then this directory needs to be shared with the victim, who then needs to run a command that evaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`, inside.\n\nThis vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which could potentially lead to the takeover of the system. However, the exploitability is very low, because it requires a lot of user interaction. Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problem by inserting `--` as an argument before any positional arguments to those Git commands that were affected by this issue. Regardless of whether users can upgrade or not, they should review any untrustred `Gemfile`'s before running any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they can contain arbitrary ruby code.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.4,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","metrics":{"baseScore":9.3,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":10.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.7,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-43809","epss":0.01825,"percentile":0.82055,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"ruby-gem-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"ruby","namespace":"github:language:ruby","package":{"name":"bundler","version":"1.17.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<2.2.33 (semver)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-fj7f-vq84-fh43"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.2.33"}}],"artifact":{"id":"b9368fa02081fd14","name":"bundler","version":"1.17.2","type":"gem","locations":[{"path":"/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/specifications/default/bundler-1.17.2.gemspec","accessPath":"/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/specifications/default/bundler-1.17.2.gemspec","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"ruby","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:jessica-lynn-suttles:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jessica_lynn_suttles:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:stephanie-morillo:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:stephanie_morillo:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:hiroshi-shibata:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:hiroshi_shibata:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:colby-swandale:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:colby_swandale:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:samuel-giddins:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:samuel_giddins:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:chris-morris:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:chris_morris:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:carl-lerche:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:carl_lerche:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:terence-lee:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:terence_lee:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:yehuda-katz:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:yehuda_katz:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:grey-baker:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:grey_baker:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:james-wen:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:james_wen:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ruby-lang:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ruby_lang:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:tim-moore:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:tim_moore:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:bundler:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ruby:bundler:1.17.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:gem/bundler@1.17.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-v5h6-c2hv-hv3r","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v5h6-c2hv-hv3r","namespace":"github:language:ruby","severity":"Critical","urls":[],"description":"StringIO buffer overread vulnerability","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-27280","epss":0.01123,"percentile":0.77271,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.0.1.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":1.0556200000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-27280","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27280","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://hackerone.com/reports/1399856","https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2024/03/21/buffer-overread-cve-2024-27280/","https://hackerone.com/reports/1399856","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250502-0003/","https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2024/03/21/buffer-overread-cve-2024-27280/"],"description":"A buffer-overread issue was discovered in StringIO 3.0.1, as distributed in Ruby 3.0.x through 3.0.6 and 3.1.x through 3.1.4.

is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14, `Rack::QueryParser` parses query strings and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies into Ruby data structures without imposing any limit on the number of parameters, allowing attackers to send requests with extremely large numbers of parameters. The vulnerability arises because `Rack::QueryParser` iterates over each `&`-separated key-value pair and adds it to a Hash without enforcing an upper bound on the total number of parameters. This allows an attacker to send a single request containing hundreds of thousands (or more) of parameters, which consumes excessive memory and CPU during parsing. An attacker can trigger denial of service by sending specifically crafted HTTP requests, which can cause memory exhaustion or pin CPU resources, stalling or crashing the Rack server. This results in full service disruption until the affected worker is restarted. Versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14 fix the issue. Some other mitigations are available. One may use middleware to enforce a maximum query string size or parameter count, or employ a reverse proxy (such as Nginx) to limit request sizes and reject oversized query strings or bodies. Limiting request body sizes and query string lengths at the web server or CDN level is an effective mitigation.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-46727","epss":0.01095,"percentile":0.76964,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"ruby-gem-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"ruby","namespace":"github:language:ruby","package":{"name":"rack","version":"2.2.3"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<2.2.14 (semver)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-gjh7-p2fx-99vx"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.2.14"}}],"artifact":{"id":"b03c43e0858f18c4","name":"rack","version":"2.2.3","type":"gem","locations":[{"path":"/api/vendor_installed/bundle/ruby/2.6.0/specifications/rack-2.2.3.gemspec","accessPath":"/api/vendor_installed/bundle/ruby/2.6.0/specifications/rack-2.2.3.gemspec","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"ruby","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:rack:rack:2.2.3:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:gem/rack@2.2.3","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-crjr-9rc5-ghw8","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-crjr-9rc5-ghw8","namespace":"github:language:ruby","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Nokogiri Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-24836","epss":0.01055,"percentile":0.76594,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.13.4"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.7912499999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-24836","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24836","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Dec/23","https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/commit/e444525ef1634b675cd1cf52d39f4320ef0aecfd","https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-crjr-9rc5-ghw8","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00013.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/10/msg00018.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6DHCOWMA5PQTIQIMDENA7R2Y5BDYAIYM/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OUPLBUZVM4WPFSXBEP2JS3R6LMKRTLFC/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XMDCWRQXJQ3TFSETPCEFMQ6RR6ME5UA3/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-29","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213532","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Dec/23","https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/commit/e444525ef1634b675cd1cf52d39f4320ef0aecfd","https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-crjr-9rc5-ghw8","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00013.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/10/msg00018.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/09/msg00010.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6DHCOWMA5PQTIQIMDENA7R2Y5BDYAIYM/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OUPLBUZVM4WPFSXBEP2JS3R6LMKRTLFC/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XMDCWRQXJQ3TFSETPCEFMQ6RR6ME5UA3/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-29","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213532"],"description":"Nokogiri is an open source XML and HTML library for Ruby.

A malicious server can use this in rare unfortunate circumstances to potentially reach remote code execution in the client. When libcurl at run-time sets up support for TLS 1.3 session tickets on a connection using OpenSSL, it stores pointers to the transfer in-memory object for later retrieval when a session ticket arrives. If the connection is used by multiple transfers (like with a reused HTTP/1.1 connection or multiplexed HTTP/2 connection) that first transfer object might be freed before the new session is established on that connection and then the function will access a memory buffer that might be freed. When using that memory, libcurl might even call a function pointer in the object, making it possible for a remote code execution if the server could somehow manage to get crafted memory content into the correct place in memory.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-22901","epss":0.0052,"percentile":0.65888,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":""},"advisories":[],"risk":0.38869999999999993},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:oracle:mysql:5.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"mysql","version":"5.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2021-22901","versionConstraint":"<= 5.7.34,>= 6.0, <= 8.0.25 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:oracle:mysql:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}}],"artifact":{"id":"23884d253f8ea671","name":"mysql","version":"5.7","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/mysql","accessPath":"/usr/bin/mysql","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:oracle:mysql:5.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/mysql@5.7","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2016-5612","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-5612","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1601.html","http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2130.html","http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2131.html","http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2595.html","http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2927.html","http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2016-2881722.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/93630","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1037050","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201701-01","http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1601.html","http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2130.html","http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2131.html","http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2595.html","http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2927.html","http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2016-2881722.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/93630","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1037050","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201701-01"],"description":"Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle MySQL 5.5.50 and earlier, 5.6.31 and earlier, and 5.7.13 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to affect availability via vectors related to DML.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4,"exploitabilityScore":8,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2016-5612","epss":0.00758,"percentile":0.72216,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":""},"advisories":[],"risk":0.38847499999999996},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:oracle:mysql:5.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"mysql","version":"5.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2016-5612","versionConstraint":">= 5.5.0, <= 5.5.50,>= 5.6.0, <= 5.6.31,>= 5.7.0, <= 5.7.13 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:oracle:mysql:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}}],"artifact":{"id":"23884d253f8ea671","name":"mysql","version":"5.7","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/mysql","accessPath":"/usr/bin/mysql","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:oracle:mysql:5.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/mysql@5.7","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2020-14830","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14830","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-27","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20201023-0003/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-27","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20201023-0003/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html"],"description":"Vulnerability in the MySQL Server product of Oracle MySQL (component: Server: Optimizer).

When using Puma behind a proxy that does not properly validate that the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard, Puma and the frontend proxy may disagree on where a request starts and ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-end proxy to Puma. The vulnerability has been fixed in 5.6.4 and 4.3.12. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.

Prior to `puma` version `5.6.2`, `puma` may not always call `close` on the response body. Rails, prior to version `7.0.2.2`, depended on the response body being closed in order for its `CurrentAttributes` implementation to work correctly. The combination of these two behaviors (Puma not closing the body + Rails' Executor implementation) causes information leakage. This problem is fixed in Puma versions 5.6.2 and 4.3.11. This problem is fixed in Rails versions 7.02.2, 6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, and 5.2.6.2.

X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.3,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-1971","epss":0.00264,"percentile":0.49787,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":""},"advisories":[],"risk":0.13332000000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:oracle:mysql:5.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"mysql","version":"5.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-1971","versionConstraint":"<= 8.0.22 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:oracle:mysql:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}}],"artifact":{"id":"23884d253f8ea671","name":"mysql","version":"5.7","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/mysql","accessPath":"/usr/bin/mysql","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:oracle:mysql:5.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/mysql@5.7","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2018-3064","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-3064","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2018-4258247.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104776","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041294","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3655","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1258","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/08/msg00036.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20180726-0002/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3725-1/","https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4341","http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2018-4258247.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104776","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041294","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3655","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1258","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/08/msg00036.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20180726-0002/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3725-1/","https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4341"],"description":"Vulnerability in the MySQL Server component of Oracle MySQL (subcomponent: InnoDB).

is a HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. Prior to versions 5.5.1 and 4.3.9, using `puma` with a proxy which forwards HTTP header values which contain the LF character could allow HTTP request smugggling. A client could smuggle a request through a proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client. The only proxy which has this behavior, as far as the Puma team is aware of, is Apache Traffic Server. If the proxy uses persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however, would see it as two requests, and when processing the second request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send another request for a different client, the second response from the first client will be sent to the second client. This vulnerability was patched in Puma 5.5.1 and 4.3.9. As a workaround, do not use Apache Traffic Server with `puma`.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.7,"exploitabilityScore":1.2,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.6,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.7,"exploitabilityScore":1.2,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-41136","epss":0.00379,"percentile":0.58652,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"ruby-gem-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"ruby","namespace":"github:language:ruby","package":{"name":"puma","version":"4.0.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<4.3.9

However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris).

provides an interface for developing web applications in Ruby. Prior to versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12, `Rack::Static` can serve files under the specified `root:` even if `urls:` are provided, which may expose other files under the specified `root:` unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs because `Rack::Static` does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically, encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified `root:` directory, provided they are able to determine then path of the file. Versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue. Other mitigations include removing usage of `Rack::Static`, or ensuring that `root:` points at a directory path which only contains files which should be accessed publicly. It is likely that a CDN or similar static file server would also mitigate the issue.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27610","epss":0.00108,"percentile":0.30236,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"ruby-gem-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"ruby","namespace":"github:language:ruby","package":{"name":"rack","version":"2.2.3"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<2.2.13 (semver)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-7wqh-767x-r66v"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.2.13"}}],"artifact":{"id":"b03c43e0858f18c4","name":"rack","version":"2.2.3","type":"gem","locations":[{"path":"/api/vendor_installed/bundle/ruby/2.6.0/specifications/rack-2.2.3.gemspec","accessPath":"/api/vendor_installed/bundle/ruby/2.6.0/specifications/rack-2.2.3.gemspec","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"ruby","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:rack:rack:2.2.3:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:gem/rack@2.2.3","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2017-3653","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-3653","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Low","urls":["http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3922","http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3944","http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2017-3236622.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99810","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038928","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2787","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2886","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0279","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0574","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2439","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2729","https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3955","http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3922","http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3944","http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2017-3236622.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99810","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038928","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2787","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2886","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0279","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0574","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2439","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2729","https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3955"],"description":"Vulnerability in the MySQL Server component of Oracle MySQL (subcomponent: Server: DDL).

Carefully crafted text can cause the block_format helper to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release should either upgrade to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, or 7.2.1.1 or apply the relevant patch immediately. As a workaround, users can avoid calling the `block_format` helper or upgrade to Ruby 3.2. Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected.

Prior to version 2.2.14, when using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, simultaneous rack requests can restore a deleted rack session, which allows the unauthenticated user to occupy that session. Rack session middleware prepares the session at the beginning of request, then saves is back to the store with possible changes applied by host rack application. This way the session becomes to be a subject of race conditions in general sense over concurrent rack requests. When using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, and provided the attacker can acquire a session cookie (already a major issue), the session may be restored if the attacker can trigger a long running request (within that same session) adjacent to the user logging out, in order to retain illicit access even after a user has attempted to logout. Version 2.2.14 contains a patch for the issue. Some other mitigations are available. Either ensure the application invalidates sessions atomically by marking them as logged out e.g., using a `logged_out` flag, instead of deleting them, and check this flag on every request to prevent reuse; or implement a custom session store that tracks session invalidation timestamps and refuses to accept session data if the session was invalidated after the request began.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-32441","epss":0.00018,"percentile":0.02981,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"ruby-gem-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"ruby","namespace":"github:language:ruby","package":{"name":"rack","version":"2.2.3"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<=2.2.13 (semver)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-vpfw-47h7-xj4g"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.2.14"}}],"artifact":{"id":"b03c43e0858f18c4","name":"rack","version":"2.2.3","type":"gem","locations":[{"path":"/api/vendor_installed/bundle/ruby/2.6.0/specifications/rack-2.2.3.gemspec","accessPath":"/api/vendor_installed/bundle/ruby/2.6.0/specifications/rack-2.2.3.gemspec","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"ruby","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:rack:rack:2.2.3:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:gem/rack@2.2.3","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-21611","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21611","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EG3VBUHKCUXVWBSCD2FHCWIAMZO4X3PR/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NGZ4B5IQJEZQFSXGCZKSJ6GO3HLQ6URQ/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221028-0013/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2022.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EG3VBUHKCUXVWBSCD2FHCWIAMZO4X3PR/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NGZ4B5IQJEZQFSXGCZKSJ6GO3HLQ6URQ/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221028-0013/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2022.html"],"description":"Vulnerability in the MySQL Server product of Oracle MySQL (component: InnoDB).
