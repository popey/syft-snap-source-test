Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information. This issue has been patched in version 2.31.0.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-32681","epss":0.04731,"percentile":0.88915,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"requests","version":"2.28.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=2.3.0,<2.31.0 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.31.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"d2b852f7ae818a0f","name":"requests","version":"2.28.2","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/requests-2.28.2.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/requests-2.28.2.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/requests-2.28.2.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/requests-2.28.2.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/requests-2.28.2.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/requests-2.28.2.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["Apache 2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:requests:2.28.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/requests@2.28.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-248v-346w-9cwc","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-248v-346w-9cwc","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"Certifi removes GLOBALTRUST root certificate","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-39689","epss":0.01928,"percentile":0.82507,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["2024.7.4"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.5783999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-39689","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39689","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi/commit/bd8153872e9c6fc98f4023df9c2deaffea2fa463","https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi/security/advisories/GHSA-248v-346w-9cwc","https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy/c/XpknYMPO8dI","https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi/commit/bd8153872e9c6fc98f4023df9c2deaffea2fa463","https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi/security/advisories/GHSA-248v-346w-9cwc","https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy/c/XpknYMPO8dI","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241206-0001/"],"description":"Certifi is a curated collection of Root Certificates for validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity of TLS hosts.

Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised.

When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not user the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigations.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37891","epss":0.00033,"percentile":0.08049,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"1.26.14"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.26.19 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.26.19"}}],"artifact":{"id":"43a06cf63dec069c","name":"urllib3","version":"1.26.14","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.14.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.14.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.14.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.14.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.14.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.14.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:urllib3:1.26.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/urllib3@1.26.14","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Requests `Session` object does not verify requests after making first request with verify=False","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.6,"exploitabilityScore":0.4,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-35195","epss":0.00009,"percentile":0.00549,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.32.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.004770000000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-35195","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35195","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/psf/requests/commit/a58d7f2ffb4d00b46dca2d70a3932a0b37e22fac","https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6655","https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IYLSNK5TL46Q6XPRVMHVWS63MVJQOK4Q/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/N7WP6EYDSUOCOJYHDK5NX43PYZ4SNHGZ/","https://github.com/psf/requests/commit/a58d7f2ffb4d00b46dca2d70a3932a0b37e22fac","https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6655","https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IYLSNK5TL46Q6XPRVMHVWS63MVJQOK4Q/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/N7WP6EYDSUOCOJYHDK5NX43PYZ4SNHGZ/"],"description":"Requests is a HTTP library.
