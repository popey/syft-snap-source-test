In `bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted and apparently harmless `Gemfile`'s, it is not expected that they lead to execution of external code, unless that's explicit in the ruby code inside the `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile` includes `gem` entries that use the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly harmless, values with a leading dash, this can be false. To handle dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Bundler uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Bundler versions before 2.2.33 correctly avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. Since this value comes from the `Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a directory containing a `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Git repository. This dependency has to have a Git URL in the form of `-u./payload`. This URL will be used to construct a Git clone command but will be interpreted as the upload-pack argument. Then this directory needs to be shared with the victim, who then needs to run a command that evaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`, inside.\n\nThis vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which could potentially lead to the takeover of the system. However, the exploitability is very low, because it requires a lot of user interaction. Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problem by inserting `--` as an argument before any positional arguments to those Git commands that were affected by this issue. Regardless of whether users can upgrade or not, they should review any untrustred `Gemfile`'s before running any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they can contain arbitrary ruby code.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.4,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","metrics":{"baseScore":9.3,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":10.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.7,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-43809","epss":0.01825,"percentile":0.82055,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"ruby-gem-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"ruby","namespace":"github:language:ruby","package":{"name":"bundler","version":"2.2.22"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<2.2.33 (semver)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-fj7f-vq84-fh43"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.2.33"}}],"artifact":{"id":"29f901e80a5cac89","name":"bundler","version":"2.2.22","type":"gem","locations":[{"path":"/usr/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/specifications/default/bundler-2.2.22.gemspec","accessPath":"/usr/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/specifications/default/bundler-2.2.22.gemspec","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"ruby","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:jessica-lynn-suttles:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jessica_lynn_suttles:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:stephanie-morillo:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:stephanie_morillo:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:hiroshi-shibata:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:hiroshi_shibata:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:colby-swandale:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:colby_swandale:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:samuel-giddins:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:samuel_giddins:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:chris-morris:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:chris_morris:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:carl-lerche:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:carl_lerche:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:terence-lee:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:terence_lee:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:yehuda-katz:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:yehuda_katz:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:grey-baker:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:grey_baker:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:james-wen:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:james_wen:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ruby-lang:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ruby_lang:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:tim-moore:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:tim_moore:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:bundler:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ruby:bundler:2.2.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:gem/bundler@2.2.22","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-v5h6-c2hv-hv3r","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v5h6-c2hv-hv3r","namespace":"github:language:ruby","severity":"Critical","urls":[],"description":"StringIO buffer overread vulnerability","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-27280","epss":0.01123,"percentile":0.77271,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.0.1.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":1.0556200000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-27280","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27280","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://hackerone.com/reports/1399856","https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2024/03/21/buffer-overread-cve-2024-27280/","https://hackerone.com/reports/1399856","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250502-0003/","https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2024/03/21/buffer-overread-cve-2024-27280/"],"description":"A buffer-overread issue was discovered in StringIO 3.0.1, as distributed in Ruby 3.0.x through 3.0.6 and 3.1.x through 3.1.4.

Prior to versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14, `Rack::QueryParser` parses query strings and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies into Ruby data structures without imposing any limit on the number of parameters, allowing attackers to send requests with extremely large numbers of parameters. The vulnerability arises because `Rack::QueryParser` iterates over each `&`-separated key-value pair and adds it to a Hash without enforcing an upper bound on the total number of parameters. This allows an attacker to send a single request containing hundreds of thousands (or more) of parameters, which consumes excessive memory and CPU during parsing. An attacker can trigger denial of service by sending specifically crafted HTTP requests, which can cause memory exhaustion or pin CPU resources, stalling or crashing the Rack server. This results in full service disruption until the affected worker is restarted. Versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14 fix the issue. Some other mitigations are available. One may use middleware to enforce a maximum query string size or parameter count, or employ a reverse proxy (such as Nginx) to limit request sizes and reject oversized query strings or bodies. Limiting request body sizes and query string lengths at the web server or CDN level is an effective mitigation.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-46727","epss":0.01095,"percentile":0.76964,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"ruby-gem-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"ruby","namespace":"github:language:ruby","package":{"name":"rack","version":"2.2.9"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<2.2.14 (semver)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-gjh7-p2fx-99vx"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.2.14"}}],"artifact":{"id":"09cbc61123d34790","name":"rack","version":"2.2.9","type":"gem","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/gems/3.0.0/specifications/rack-2.2.9.gemspec","accessPath":"/var/lib/gems/3.0.0/specifications/rack-2.2.9.gemspec","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"ruby","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:rack:rack:2.2.9:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:gem/rack@2.2.9","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-5866-49gr-22v4","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5866-49gr-22v4","namespace":"github:language:ruby","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"REXML DoS vulnerability","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-41946","epss":0.00763,"percentile":0.72339,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.3.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.47687499999999994},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-41946","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41946","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/ruby/rexml/commit/033d1909a8f259d5a7c53681bcaf14f13bcf0368","https://github.com/ruby/rexml/security/advisories/GHSA-5866-49gr-22v4","https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2008/08/23/dos-vulnerability-in-rexml","https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2024/08/01/dos-rexml-cve-2024-41946","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250117-0007/"],"description":"REXML is an XML toolkit for Ruby.

The vulnerability occurs because `Rack::Static` does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically, encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory.

Prior to version 2.2.14, when using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, simultaneous rack requests can restore a deleted rack session, which allows the unauthenticated user to occupy that session. Rack session middleware prepares the session at the beginning of request, then saves is back to the store with possible changes applied by host rack application. This way the session becomes to be a subject of race conditions in general sense over concurrent rack requests. When using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, and provided the attacker can acquire a session cookie (already a major issue), the session may be restored if the attacker can trigger a long running request (within that same session) adjacent to the user logging out, in order to retain illicit access even after a user has attempted to logout. Version 2.2.14 contains a patch for the issue. Some other mitigations are available. Either ensure the application invalidates sessions atomically by marking them as logged out e.g., using a `logged_out` flag, instead of deleting them, and check this flag on every request to prevent reuse; or implement a custom session store that tracks session invalidation timestamps and refuses to accept session data if the session was invalidated after the request began.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-32441","epss":0.00018,"percentile":0.02981,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"ruby-gem-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"ruby","namespace":"github:language:ruby","package":{"name":"rack","version":"2.2.9"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<=2.2.13
