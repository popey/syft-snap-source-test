a protocol selection parameter option disables all protocols without adding any then the default set of protocols would remain in the allowed set due to an error in the logic for removing protocols. The below command would perform a request to curl.se with a plaintext protocol which has been explicitly disabled.      curl --proto -all,-http http://curl.se  The flaw is only present if the set of selected protocols disables the entire set of available protocols, in itself a command with no practical use and therefore unlikely to be encountered in real situations. The curl security team has thus assessed this to be low severity bug.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.1,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-2004","epss":0.00465,"percentile":0.6343,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["8.7.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.15112499999999995},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:haxx:curl:8.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"curl","version":"8.4.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-2004","versionConstraint":">= 7.85.0, < 8.7.0 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:haxx:curl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"8.7.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"bd52c4a350f0cca5","name":"curl","version":"8.4.0","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/curl","accessPath":"/usr/bin/curl","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:haxx:curl:8.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/curl@8.4.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-rgv9-q543-rqg4","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rgv9-q543-rqg4","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in FasterXML jackson-databind","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-42004","epss":0.0018,"percentile":0.4039,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.12.7.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.135},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-42004","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42004","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=50490","https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/063183589218fec19a9293ed2f17ec53ea80ba88","https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3582","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00035.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-21","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221118-0008/","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5283","https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=50490","https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/063183589218fec19a9293ed2f17ec53ea80ba88","https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3582","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00035.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-21","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221118-0008/","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5283"],"description":"In FasterXML jackson-databind before 2.13.4, resource exhaustion can occur because of a lack of a check in BeanDeserializer._deserializeFromArray to prevent use of deeply nested arrays.

is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.5, An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to store a reference to a malicious string's format method, then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja, but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox.

Prior to 3.1.6, an oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment interacts with the |attr filter allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to use the |attr filter to get a reference to a string's plain format method, bypassing the sandbox. After the fix, the |attr filter no longer bypasses the environment's attribute lookup.

When using versions of Babel prior to 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17 to compile regular expression named capturing groups, Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`). Generated code is vulnerable if all the following conditions are true: Using Babel to compile regular expression named capturing groups, using the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups, and the code using untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`. This problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17. It's likely that individual users do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees use of a new enough `@babel/helpers` version. Note that just updating Babel dependencies is not enough; one will also need to re-compile the code.
