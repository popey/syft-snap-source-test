A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s Notification Manager API. The vulnerability exploits TinyMCE's unfiltered notification system, which is used in error handling. The conditions for this exploit requires carefully crafted malicious content to have been inserted into the editor and a notification to have been triggered. When a notification was opened, the HTML within the text argument was displayed unfiltered in the notification. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when an notification presented in the TinyMCE UI for the current user.  This issue could also be exploited by any integration which uses a TinyMCE notification to display unfiltered HTML content. This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.10.8 and TinyMCE 6.7.1 by ensuring that the HTML displayed in the notification is sanitized, preventing the exploit. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this

The `WriteBind()` method in `src/Npgsql/Internal/NpgsqlConnector.FrontendMessages.cs` uses `int` variables to store the message length and the sum of parameter lengths. Both variables overflow when the sum of parameter lengths becomes too large. This causes Npgsql to write a message size that is too small when constructing a Postgres protocol message to send it over the network to the database. When parsing the message, the database will only read a small number of bytes and treat any following bytes as new messages while they belong to the old message. Attackers can abuse this to inject arbitrary Postgres protocol messages into the connection, leading to the execution of arbitrary SQL statements on the application's behalf.

Text nodes within specific parents are not escaped upon serialization according to the HTML standard. If such text nodes contain a special character reserved as an internal marker, they can be combined with other HTML patterns to form malicious snippets. These snippets pass the initial sanitisation layer when the content is parsed into the editor body, but can trigger XSS when the special internal marker is removed from the content and re-parsed. his vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE versions 6.7.3 and 5.10.9. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-48219","epss":0.00775,"percentile":0.72572,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tinymce","version":"5.3.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<5.10.9 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v626-r774-j7f8"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"5.10.9"}}],"artifact":{"id":"3fe569950edfd499","name":"tinymce","version":"5.3.1","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/qspro/wwwroot/lib/tinymce/package.json","accessPath":"/qspro/wwwroot/lib/tinymce/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["LGPL-2.1"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tinymce:tinymce:5.3.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tinymce@5.3.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-w7jx-j77m-wp65","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w7jx-j77m-wp65","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Cross-site scripting vulnerability in TinyMCE","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-21911","epss":0.00818,"percentile":0.73313,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["5.6.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.409},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-21911","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21911","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w7jx-j77m-wp65","https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/security/advisories/GHSA-w7jx-j77m-wp65","https://vulncheck.com/advisories/vc-advisory-GHSA-w7jx-j77m-wp65","https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinymce","https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/release-notes/release-notes56/#securityfixes","https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w7jx-j77m-wp65","https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/security/advisories/GHSA-w7jx-j77m-wp65","https://vulncheck.com/advisories/vc-advisory-GHSA-w7jx-j77m-wp65","https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinymce","https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/release-notes/release-notes56/#securityfixes"],"description":"TinyMCE versions before 5.6.0 are affected by a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.

is an open source rich text editor. A mutation cross-site scripting (mXSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s core undo and redo functionality. When a carefully-crafted HTML snippet passes the XSS sanitisation layer, it is manipulated as a string by internal trimming functions before being stored in the undo stack. If the HTML snippet is restored from the undo stack, the combination of the string manipulation and reparative parsing by either the browser's native [DOMParser API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser) (TinyMCE 6) or the SaxParser API (TinyMCE 5) mutates the HTML maliciously, allowing an XSS payload to be executed.
