LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed.

LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed.

LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed.

LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed.

was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations.

Log4j 2.16.0 (Java 8) and 2.12.2 (Java 7) fix this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.1,"exploitabilityScore":5,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"knownExploited":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-45046","vendorProject":"Apache","product":"Log4j2","dateAdded":"2023-05-01","requiredAction":"Apply updates per vendor instructions.","dueDate":"2023-05-22","knownRansomwareCampaignUse":"known","urls":["https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046"],"cwes":["CWE-917"]}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-45046","epss":0.94313,"percentile":0.99939,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"log4j-core","version":"2.14.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=2.13.0,<2.16.0 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.16.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a03bf79410fead61","name":"log4j-core","version":"2.14.0","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/gluu-opt/dist/gluu/fido2.war","accessPath":"/gluu-opt/dist/gluu/fido2.war:WEB-INF/lib/log4j-core-2.14.0.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":["https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:apache:log4j-core:2.14.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:log4j_core:2.14.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:log4j:2.14.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:core:2.14.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core@2.14.0","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/gluu-opt/dist/gluu/fido2.war:WEB-INF/lib/log4j-core-2.14.0.jar","pomArtifactID":"log4j-core","pomGroupID":"org.apache.logging.log4j","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"e257b0562453f73eabac1bc3181ba33e79d193ed"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-599f-7c49-w659","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-599f-7c49-w659","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"Critical","urls":[],"description":"Arbitrary code execution in Apache Commons Text","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-42889","epss":0.94161,"percentile":0.99906,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.10.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":88.51134},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-42889","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42889","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171003/OX-App-Suite-Cross-Site-Scripting-Server-Side-Request-Forgery.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/176650/Apache-Commons-Text-1.9-Remote-Code-Execution.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Feb/3","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/10/13/4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/10/18/1","https://lists.apache.org/thread/n2bd4vdsgkqh2tm14l1wyc3jyol7s1om","https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2022-0022","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202301-05","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221020-0004/","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171003/OX-App-Suite-Cross-Site-Scripting-Server-Side-Request-Forgery.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/176650/Apache-Commons-Text-1.9-Remote-Code-Execution.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Feb/3","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/10/13/4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/10/18/1","https://lists.apache.org/thread/n2bd4vdsgkqh2tm14l1wyc3jyol7s1om","https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2022-0022","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202301-05","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221020-0004/"],"description":"Apache Commons Text performs variable interpolation, allowing properties to be dynamically evaluated and expanded.

is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. When using aiohttp as a web server and configuring static routes, it is necessary to specify the root path for static files. Additionally, the option 'follow_symlinks' can be used to determine whether to follow symbolic links outside the static root directory. When 'follow_symlinks' is set to True, there is no validation to check if reading a file is within the root directory. This can lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities, resulting in unauthorized access to arbitrary files on the system, even when symlinks are not present.

is a java based web server and servlet engine. In affected versions servlets with multipart support (e.g. annotated with `@MultipartConfig`) that call `HttpServletRequest.getParameter()` or `HttpServletRequest.getParts()` may cause `OutOfMemoryError` when the client sends a multipart request with a part that has a name but no filename and very large content. This happens even with the default settings of `fileSizeThreshold=0` which should stream the whole part content to disk. An attacker client may send a large multipart request and cause the server to throw `OutOfMemoryError`. However, the server may be able to recover after the `OutOfMemoryError` and continue its service -- although it may take some time. This issue has been patched in versions 9.4.51, 10.0.14, and 11.0.14. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may set the multipart parameter `maxRequestSize` which must be set to a non-negative value, so the whole multipart content is limited (although still read into memory).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-26048","epss":0.4117,"percentile":0.97233,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"jetty-server","version":"9.4.31.v20200723"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<9.4.51.v20230217

The message converter, %m, is likely to always be included. This allows attackers to manipulate the SQL by entering crafted strings into input fields or headers of an application that are logged allowing unintended SQL queries to be executed. Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically configured to use the JDBCAppender, which is not the default. Beginning in version 2.0-beta8, the JDBCAppender was re-introduced with proper support for parameterized SQL queries and further customization over the columns written to in logs. Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life in August 2015.

Vulnerable code is used by aiohttp for its HTTP request parser when available which is the default case when installing from a wheel. This vulnerability only affects users of aiohttp as an HTTP server (ie `aiohttp.Application`), you are not affected by this vulnerability if you are using aiohttp as an HTTP client library (ie `aiohttp.ClientSession`). Sending a crafted HTTP request will cause the server to misinterpret one of the HTTP header values leading to HTTP request smuggling. This issue has been addressed in version 3.8.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade can reinstall aiohttp using `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1` as an environment variable to disable the llhttp HTTP request parser implementation. The pure Python implementation isn't vulnerable.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-37276","epss":0.05842,"percentile":0.9011,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"aiohttp","version":"3.7.4.post0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<=3.8.4 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-45c4-8wx5-qw6w"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.8.5"}}],"artifact":{"id":"4268cc6bdb0e87d7","name":"aiohttp","version":"3.7.4.post0","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/aiohttp-3.7.4.post0.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/aiohttp-3.7.4.post0.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/aiohttp-3.7.4.post0.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/aiohttp-3.7.4.post0.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/aiohttp-3.7.4.post0.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/aiohttp-3.7.4.post0.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["Apache 2"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kim_project:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kim_project:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kimproject:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kimproject:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91_project:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91_project:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91project:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91project:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-aiohttp:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-aiohttp:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_aiohttp:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_aiohttp:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kim_project:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kim:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kim:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kimproject:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91_project:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91project:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:aiohttp:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:aiohttp:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-aiohttp:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_aiohttp:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kim:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:aiohttp:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/aiohttp@3.7.4.post0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-21340","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21340","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/02/msg00011.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-05","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220121-0007/","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5057","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5058","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/02/msg00011.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-05","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220121-0007/","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5057","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5058","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html"],"description":"Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Libraries).

is a HTTP library. Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server.

is a Java based web server and servlet engine. Prior to versions 9.4.52, 10.0.16, 11.0.16, and 12.0.1, Jetty accepts the `+` character proceeding the content-length value in a HTTP/1 header field.  This is more permissive than allowed by the RFC and other servers routinely reject such requests with 400 responses.  There is no known exploit scenario, but it is conceivable that request smuggling could result if jetty is used in combination with a server that does not close the connection after sending such a 400 response.

Jetty provides a web server and servlet container. In versions 11.0.0 through 11.0.15, 10.0.0 through 10.0.15, and 9.0.0 through 9.4.52, an integer overflow in `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for HTTP/2 HPACK header values to\nexceed their size limit. `MetaDataBuilder.java` determines if a header name or value exceeds the size limit, and throws an exception if the limit is exceeded. However, when length is very large and huffman is true, the multiplication by 4 in line 295\nwill overflow, and length will become negative. `(_size+length)` will now be negative, and the check on line 296 will not be triggered. Furthermore, `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for user-entered HPACK header value sizes to be negative, potentially leading to a very large buffer allocation later on when the user-entered size is multiplied by 2. This means that if a user provides a negative length value (or, more precisely, a length value which, when multiplied by the 4/3 fudge factor, is negative), and this length value is a very large positive number when multiplied by 2, then the user can cause a very large buffer to be allocated on the server. Users of HTTP/2 can be impacted by a remote denial of service attack. The issue has been fixed in versions 11.0.16, 10.0.16, and 9.4.53. There are no known

in all versions of Log4j 1.x is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data when the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration or if the configuration references an LDAP service the attacker has access to. The attacker can provide a TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName configuration causing JMSSink to perform JNDI requests that result in remote code execution in a similar fashion to CVE-2021-4104. Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically configured to use JMSSink, which is not the default. Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from the previous

Ion is a Java implementation of the Ion data notation. Prior to version 1.10.5, a potential denial-of-service issue exists in `ion-java` for applications that use `ion-java` to deserialize Ion text encoded data, or deserialize Ion text or binary encoded data into the `IonValue` model and then invoke certain `IonValue` methods on that in-memory representation.

As quick fix users can upgrade to version 0.5.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-36124","epss":0.00471,"percentile":0.63669,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"snappy","version":"0.4"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.5 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-8wh2-6qhj-h7j9"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.5"}}],"artifact":{"id":"d5ed0196205efac0","name":"snappy","version":"0.4","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/gluu-opt/dist/gluu/casa.war","accessPath":"/gluu-opt/dist/gluu/casa.war:WEB-INF/lib/core-io-1.7.19.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":["Apache License 2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:org.iq80.snappy:snappy:0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:snappy:snappy:0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:iq80:snappy:0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/org.iq80.snappy/snappy@0.4","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/gluu-opt/dist/gluu/casa.war:WEB-INF/lib/core-io-1.7.19.jar:org.iq80.snappy:snappy","pomArtifactID":"snappy","pomGroupID":"org.iq80.snappy","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":null}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-r9hx-vwmv-q579","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r9hx-vwmv-q579","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"pypa/setuptools vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-40897","epss":0.00318,"percentile":0.54328,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["65.5.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.2385},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-40897","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40897","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/fe8a98e696241487ba6ac9f91faa38ade939ec5d/setuptools/package_index.py#L200","https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/commit/43a9c9bfa6aa626ec2a22540bea28d2ca77964be","https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/compare/v65.5.0...v65.5.1","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ADES3NLOE5QJKBLGNZNI2RGVOSQXA37R/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YNA2BAH2ACBZ4TVJZKFLCR7L23BG5C3H/","https://pyup.io/posts/pyup-discovers-redos-vulnerabilities-in-top-python-packages/","https://pyup.io/vulnerabilities/CVE-2022-40897/52495/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230214-0001/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/","https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/fe8a98e696241487ba6ac9f91faa38ade939ec5d/setuptools/package_index.py#L200","https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/commit/43a9c9bfa6aa626ec2a22540bea28d2ca77964be","https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/compare/v65.5.0...v65.5.1","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ADES3NLOE5QJKBLGNZNI2RGVOSQXA37R/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YNA2BAH2ACBZ4TVJZKFLCR7L23BG5C3H/","https://pyup.io/posts/pyup-discovers-redos-vulnerabilities-in-top-python-packages/","https://pyup.io/vulnerabilities/CVE-2022-40897/52495/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230214-0001/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/"],"description":"Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) setuptools before 65.5.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via HTML in a crafted package or custom PackageIndex page.

Prior to version 2.3.0.0, the default implementation of `Validator.getValidDirectoryPath(String, String, File, boolean)` may incorrectly treat the tested input string as a child of the specified parent directory.

When using the Django integration of versions prior to 1.14.0 of the Sentry SDK in a specific configuration it is possible to leak sensitive cookies values, including the session cookie to Sentry. These sensitive cookies could then be used by someone with access to your Sentry issues to impersonate or escalate their privileges within your application.\n\nIn order for these sensitive values to be leaked, the Sentry SDK configuration must have `sendDefaultPII` set to `True`; one must use a custom name for either `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME` or `CSRF_COOKIE_NAME` in one's Django settings; and one must not be configured in one's organization or project settings to use Sentry's data scrubbing features to account for the custom cookie names.\n\nAs of version 1.14.0, the Django integration of the `sentry-sdk` will detect the custom cookie names based on one's Django settings and will remove the values from the payload before sending the data to Sentry. As a workaround, use the SDK's filtering mechanism to remove the cookies from the payload that is sent to Sentry. For error events, this can be done with the `before_send` callback method and for performance related events (transactions) one can use the `before_send_transaction` callback method. Those who want to handle filtering of these values on the server-side can also use Sentry's advanced data scrubbing feature to account for the custom cookie names. Look for the `$http.cookies`, `$http.headers`, `$request.cookies`, or `$request.headers` fields to target with a scrubbing rule.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.6,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28117","epss":0.0014,"percentile":0.3535,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"sentry-sdk","version":"1.0.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.14.0 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-29pr-6jr8-q5jm"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.14.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"7ca07132607a09c3","name":"sentry-sdk","version":"1.0.0","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sentry_sdk-1.0.0.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sentry_sdk-1.0.0.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sentry_sdk-1.0.0.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sentry_sdk-1.0.0.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sentry_sdk-1.0.0.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sentry_sdk-1.0.0.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["BSD"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:sentry:sentry_software_development_kit:1.0.0:*:*:*:*:python:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/sentry-sdk@1.0.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-21147","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21147","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240719-0008/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2024.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240719-0008/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2024.html"],"description":"Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Hotspot).

Prior to version 3.10.2, static routes which contain files with compressed variants (`.gz` or `.br` extension) are vulnerable to path traversal outside the root directory if those variants are symbolic links. The server protects static routes from path traversal outside the root directory when `follow_symlinks=False` (default).  It does this by resolving the requested URL to an absolute path and then checking that path relative to the root. However, these checks are not performed when looking for compressed variants in the `FileResponse` class, and symbolic links are then automatically followed when performing the `Path.stat()` and `Path.open()` to send the file.

Nonstandard cookie parsing in Jetty may allow an attacker to smuggle cookies within other cookies, or otherwise perform unintended behavior by tampering with the cookie parsing mechanism. If Jetty sees a cookie VALUE that starts with `\"` (double quote), it will continue to read the cookie string until it sees a closing quote -- even if a semicolon is encountered. So, a cookie header such as: `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE=\"b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d\"` will be parsed as one cookie, with the name DISPLAY_LANGUAGE and a value of b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d instead of 3 separate cookies. This has security implications because if, say, JSESSIONID is an HttpOnly cookie, and the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie value is rendered on the page, an attacker can smuggle the JSESSIONID cookie into the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie and thereby exfiltrate it. This is significant when an intermediary is enacting some policy based on cookies, so a smuggled cookie can bypass that policy yet still be seen by the Jetty server or its logging system. This issue has been addressed in versions 9.4.51, 10.0.14, 11.0.14, and 12.0.0.beta0 and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.4,"exploitabilityScore":1,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-26049","epss":0.00322,"percentile":0.54692,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"jetty-server","version":"9.4.31.v20200723"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<9.4.51.v20230217 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-p26g-97m4-6q7c"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"9.4.51.v20230217"}}],"artifact":{"id":"c37309bfb3069871","name":"jetty-server","version":"9.4.31.v20200723","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/gluu-opt/jetty/lib/jetty-server-9.4.31.v20200723.jar","accessPath":"/gluu-opt/jetty/lib/jetty-server-9.4.31.v20200723.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":["http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0, http://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/epl-v10.php"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:org.eclipse.jetty.server:jetty-server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.eclipse.jetty.server:jetty_server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse-jetty-project:jetty-server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse-jetty-project:jetty_server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse_jetty_project:jetty-server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse_jetty_project:jetty_server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.eclipse.jetty.server:server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.eclipse.jetty.server:jetty:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.eclipse.jetty:jetty_server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse-jetty-project:server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse_jetty_project:server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse-jetty-project:jetty:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse_jetty_project:jetty:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty-server:jetty-server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty-server:jetty_server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty_server:jetty-server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty_server:jetty_server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.eclipse.jetty:server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.eclipse.jetty:jetty:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jetty-server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jetty_server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty-server:server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty_server:server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:server:jetty-server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:server:jetty_server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty-server:jetty:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty:jetty-server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty:jetty_server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty_server:jetty:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jetty:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:server:server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty:server:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:server:jetty:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty:jetty:9.4.31.v20200723:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-server@9.4.31.v20200723","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/gluu-opt/jetty/lib/jetty-server-9.4.31.v20200723.jar","pomArtifactID":"jetty-server","pomGroupID":"org.eclipse.jetty","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"b9043b4a0c17ee543aba97e80ea3a34cd8cdb600"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-21235","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21235","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2024.html"],"description":"Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Hotspot).

Version 3.10.11 fixes the issue.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":6.3},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-52304","epss":0.00153,"percentile":0.3721,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"aiohttp","version":"3.7.4.post0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<=3.10.10 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-8495-4g3g-x7pr"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.10.11"}}],"artifact":{"id":"4268cc6bdb0e87d7","name":"aiohttp","version":"3.7.4.post0","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/aiohttp-3.7.4.post0.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/aiohttp-3.7.4.post0.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/aiohttp-3.7.4.post0.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/aiohttp-3.7.4.post0.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/aiohttp-3.7.4.post0.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/aiohttp-3.7.4.post0.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["Apache 2"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kim_project:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kim_project:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kimproject:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kimproject:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91_project:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91_project:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91project:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91project:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-aiohttp:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-aiohttp:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_aiohttp:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_aiohttp:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kim_project:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kim:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kim:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kimproject:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91_project:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91project:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:aiohttp:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:aiohttp:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-aiohttp:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_aiohttp:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kim:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:aiohttp:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/aiohttp@3.7.4.post0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-8xfc-gm6g-vgpv","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8xfc-gm6g-vgpv","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Bouncy Castle certificate parsing issues cause high CPU usage during parameter evaluation.","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-29857","epss":0.00148,"percentile":0.36535,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.78"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.07622},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-29857","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29857","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/bcgit/bc-csharp/wiki/CVE%E2%80%902024%E2%80%9029857","https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/wiki/CVE%E2%80%902024%E2%80%9029857","https://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html","https://github.com/bcgit/bc-csharp/wiki/CVE%E2%80%902024%E2%80%9029857","https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/wiki/CVE%E2%80%902024%E2%80%9029857","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241206-0008/","https://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html"],"description":"An issue was discovered in ECCurve.java and ECCurve.cs in Bouncy Castle Java (BC Java) before 1.78, BC Java LTS before 2.73.6, BC-FJA before 1.0.2.5, and BC C# .Net before 2.3.1.

Prior to 3.1.5, An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to store a reference to a malicious string's format method, then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja, but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox.

However the behaviour of HttpURI\n differs from the common browsers in how it handles a URI that would be \nconsidered invalid if fully validated against the RRC.  Specifically HttpURI\n and the browser may differ on the value of the host extracted from an \ninvalid URI and thus a combination of Jetty and a vulnerable browser may\n be vulnerable to a open redirect attack or to a SSRF attack if the URI \nis used after passing validation checks.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"emo@eclipse.org","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.7,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-6763","epss":0.00118,"percentile":0.31947,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"jetty-http","version":"9.4.31.v20200723"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=7.0.0,<=12.0.11

is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Affected versions of aiohttp have a security vulnerability regarding the inconsistent interpretation of the http protocol. HTTP/1.1 is a persistent protocol, if both Content-Length(CL) and Transfer-Encoding(TE) header values are present it can lead to incorrect interpretation of two entities that parse the HTTP and we can poison other sockets with this incorrect interpretation. A possible Proof-of-Concept (POC) would be a configuration with a reverse proxy(frontend) that accepts both CL and TE headers and aiohttp as backend. As aiohttp parses anything with chunked, we can pass a chunked123 as TE, the frontend entity will ignore this header and will parse Content-Length. The impact of this vulnerability is that it is possible to bypass any proxy rule, poisoning sockets to other users like passing Authentication Headers, also if it is present an Open Redirect an attacker could combine it to redirect random users to another website and log the request. This vulnerability has been addressed in release 3.8.0 of aiohttp. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.4,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-47641","epss":0.00151,"percentile":0.36914,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"aiohttp","version":"3.7.4.post0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<3.8.0 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-xx9p-xxvh-7g8j"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.8.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"4268cc6bdb0e87d7","name":"aiohttp","version":"3.7.4.post0","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/aiohttp-3.7.4.post0.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/aiohttp-3.7.4.post0.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/aiohttp-3.7.4.post0.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/aiohttp-3.7.4.post0.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/aiohttp-3.7.4.post0.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/aiohttp-3.7.4.post0.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["Apache 2"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kim_project:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kim_project:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kimproject:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kimproject:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91_project:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91_project:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91project:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91project:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-aiohttp:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-aiohttp:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_aiohttp:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_aiohttp:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kim_project:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kim:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kim:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kimproject:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91_project:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91project:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:aiohttp:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:aiohttp:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-aiohttp:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_aiohttp:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python-aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python_aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nikolay_kim:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fafhrd91:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:aiohttp:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:aiohttp:3.7.4.post0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/aiohttp@3.7.4.post0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-21131","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21131","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Low","urls":["https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240719-0008/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2024.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240719-0008/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2024.html"],"description":"Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Hotspot).

The `xmlattr` filter in affected versions of Jinja accepts keys containing non-attribute characters. XML/HTML attributes cannot contain spaces, `/`, `>`, or `=`, as each would then be interpreted as starting a separate attribute. If an application accepts keys (as opposed to only values) as user input, and renders these in pages that other users see as well, an attacker could use this to inject other attributes and perform XSS. The fix for CVE-2024-22195 only addressed spaces but not other characters. Accepting keys as user input is now explicitly considered an unintended use case of the `xmlattr` filter, and code that does so without otherwise validating the input should be flagged as insecure, regardless of Jinja version.

Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45803","epss":0.00062,"percentile":0.1968,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"1.26.4"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=0,<1.26.18

Prior to 3.1.6, an oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment interacts with the |attr filter allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to use the |attr filter to get a reference to a string's plain format method, bypassing the sandbox.

is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not user the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigations.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37891","epss":0.00033,"percentile":0.08049,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"1.26.4"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.26.19 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.26.19"}}],"artifact":{"id":"306ea7bcfea8591c","name":"urllib3","version":"1.26.4","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.4.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.4.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.4.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.4.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.4.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.4.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:urllib3:1.26.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/urllib3@1.26.4","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-pvp8-3xj6-8c6x","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pvp8-3xj6-8c6x","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"Apache Commons Configuration Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-46392","epss":0.00042,"percentile":0.12254,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0126},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-46392","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46392","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://lists.apache.org/thread/y1pl0mn3opz6kwkm873zshjdxq3dwq5s","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29131","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29133"],"description":"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Apache Commons Configuration 1.x.\n\nThere are a number of issues in Apache Commons Configuration 1.x that allow excessive resource consumption when loading untrusted configurations or using unexpected usage patterns.

A bug in Sentry's Python SDK < 2.8.0 allows the environment variables to be passed to subprocesses despite the `env={}` setting. In Python's `subprocess` calls, all environment variables are passed to subprocesses by default. However, if you specifically do not want them to be passed to subprocesses, you may use `env` argument in `subprocess` calls. Due to the bug in Sentry SDK, with the Stdlib integration enabled (which is enabled by default), this expectation is not fulfilled, and all environment variables are being passed to subprocesses instead. The issue has been patched in pull request #3251 and is included in sentry-sdk==2.8.0. We strongly recommend upgrading to the latest SDK version. However, if it's not possible, and if passing environment variables to child processes poses a security risk for you, you can disable all default integrations.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":0.9,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-40647","epss":0.00045,"percentile":0.13371,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"sentry-sdk","version":"1.0.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<2.8.0

users on that system. A collocated user can observe the process of creating a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and race to complete the creation of the temporary subdirectory. If the attacker wins the race then they will have read and write permission to the subdirectory used to unpack web applications, including their WEB-INF/lib jar files and JSP files. If any code is ever executed out of this temporary directory, this can lead to a local privilege escalation

temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.1,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cve-coordination@google.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-8908","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00491,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"guava","version":"28.0-android"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<32.0.0-android

temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.1,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cve-coordination@google.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-8908","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00491,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"guava","version":"28.0-android"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<32.0.0-android

temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.1,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cve-coordination@google.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-8908","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00491,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"guava","version":"28.0-android"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<32.0.0-android

temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.1,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cve-coordination@google.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-8908","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00491,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"guava","version":"28.0-android"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<32.0.0-android

temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.1,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cve-coordination@google.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-8908","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00491,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"guava","version":"28.0-android"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<32.0.0-android

temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.1,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cve-coordination@google.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-8908","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00491,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"guava","version":"29.0-jre"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<32.0.0-android

temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.1,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cve-coordination@google.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-8908","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00491,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"guava","version":"29.0-jre"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<32.0.0-android

temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.1,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cve-coordination@google.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-8908","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00491,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"guava","version":"29.0-jre"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<32.0.0-android

temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.1,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cve-coordination@google.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-8908","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00491,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"guava","version":"29.0-jre"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<32.0.0-android

temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.1,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cve-coordination@google.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-8908","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00491,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"guava","version":"29.0-jre"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<32.0.0-android

temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.1,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cve-coordination@google.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-8908","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00491,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"guava","version":"29.0-jre"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<32.0.0-android

temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.1,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cve-coordination@google.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-8908","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00491,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"guava","version":"29.0-jre"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<32.0.0-android
