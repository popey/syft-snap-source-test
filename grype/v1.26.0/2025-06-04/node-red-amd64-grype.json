This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.

is an extension to the popular JSON file format that aims to be easier to write and maintain by hand (e.g. for config files). The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including versions 1.0.1 and 2.2.1 does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse` should restrict parsing of `__proto__` keys when parsing JSON strings to objects. As a point of reference, the `JSON.parse` method included in JavaScript ignores `__proto__` keys. Simply changing `JSON5.parse` to `JSON.parse` in the examples above mitigates this vulnerability. This vulnerability is patched in json5 versions 1.0.2, 2.2.2, and later.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":5.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-46175","epss":0.41091,"percentile":0.97228,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"json5","version":"0.2.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.0.2 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.0.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"498536fb53e3cb38","name":"json5","version":"0.2.0","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/node-red/node_modules/i18next/node_modules/json5/package.json","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/node-red/node_modules/i18next/node_modules/json5/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:json5:json5:0.2.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/json5@0.2.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2018-1000802","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000802","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00040.html","https://bugs.python.org/issue34540","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/8985","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/8985/commits/add531a1e55b0a739b0f42582f1c9747e5649ace","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/09/msg00030.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/09/msg00031.html","https://mega.nz/#%21JUFiCC4R%21mq-jQ8ySFwIhX6WMDujaZuNBfttDVt7DETlfOIQE1ig","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230309-0002/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-2/","https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4306","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00040.html","https://bugs.python.org/issue34540","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/8985","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/8985/commits/add531a1e55b0a739b0f42582f1c9747e5649ace","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/09/msg00030.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/09/msg00031.html","https://mega.nz/#%21JUFiCC4R%21mq-jQ8ySFwIhX6WMDujaZuNBfttDVt7DETlfOIQE1ig","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230309-0002/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-2/","https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4306"],"description":"Python Software Foundation Python (CPython) version 2.7 contains a CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') vulnerability in shutil module (make_archive function) that can result in Denial of service, Information gain via injection of arbitrary files on the system or entire drive.

is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th generation). Note: The impact from this issue is similar to CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2015-3193. OpenSSL version 1.0.2-1.0.2m and 1.1.0-1.1.0g are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time. The fix will be included in OpenSSL 1.1.0h when it becomes available. The fix is also available in commit e502cc86d in the OpenSSL git repository.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.3,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2017-3738","epss":0.11761,"percentile":0.93349,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["4.8.7","6.12.2","8.9.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":5.939305},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:4.4.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"4.4.4"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2017-3738","versionConstraint":">=

is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure in OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c that handles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private keys are impossible. This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations with the private key itself and an input of the attacker's direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely.

Even then only clients that chose the curve will be affected.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":2.6,"exploitabilityScore":5,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2016-7055","epss":0.09577,"percentile":0.92478,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["4.7.3","6.9.5"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":4.4293625},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:4.4.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"4.4.4"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2016-7055","versionConstraint":">= 4.2.0, < 4.7.3,>= 6.9.0, < 6.9.5 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"4.7.3"}}],"artifact":{"id":"5acbfb099df84906","name":"node","version":"4.4.4","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/node","accessPath":"/bin/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:4.4.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/node@4.4.4","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-48565","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-48565","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://bugs.python.org/issue42051","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00022.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00017.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AFHYAGWBFBNUGWU6XWKBHTCV5NH77MB7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BAYWJD576JUKLHCWKDLMJSUGTRDKPF3M/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KZRZRJHWLZ7MOJNPQBWGJVXMVYDC5BRA/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0007/","https://bugs.python.org/issue42051","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00022.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00017.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AFHYAGWBFBNUGWU6XWKBHTCV5NH77MB7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BAYWJD576JUKLHCWKDLMJSUGTRDKPF3M/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KZRZRJHWLZ7MOJNPQBWGJVXMVYDC5BRA/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0007/"],"description":"An XML External Entity (XXE) issue was discovered in Python through 3.9.1.

No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. For example this can occur by default in OpenSSL DHE based SSL/TLS ciphersuites. Note: This issue is very similar to CVE-2015-3193 but must be treated as a separate

still allows an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the application.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-10160","epss":0.01722,"percentile":0.8154,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.7.17","3.5.8","3.6.9","3.7.4"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":1.4809200000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"2.7.12"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-10160","versionConstraint":">= 2.7.0, < 2.7.17,>= 3.5.0, < 3.5.8,>= 3.6.0, < 3.6.9,>= 3.7.0, < 3.7.4,= 3.8.0-alpha4,= 3.8.0-beta1 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.7.17"}}],"artifact":{"id":"74dc27ec36c075ab","name":"python","version":"2.7.12","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/python2.7","accessPath":"/usr/bin/python2.7","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@2.7.12","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-pw54-mh39-w3hc","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pw54-mh39-w3hc","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Regular expression denial of service in npm-user-validate","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-7754","epss":0.0163,"percentile":0.81038,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.0.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":1.2225},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2020-7754","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7754","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/npm/npm-user-validate/commit/c8a87dac1a4cc6988b5418f30411a8669bef204e","https://github.com/npm/npm-user-validate/security/advisories/GHSA-xgh6-85xh-479p","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-1019353","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-NPMUSERVALIDATE-1019352","https://github.com/npm/npm-user-validate/commit/c8a87dac1a4cc6988b5418f30411a8669bef204e","https://github.com/npm/npm-user-validate/security/advisories/GHSA-xgh6-85xh-479p","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-1019353","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-NPMUSERVALIDATE-1019352"],"description":"This affects the package npm-user-validate before 1.0.1.

file whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9.

The HTTP specification does not allow for spaces in the `Content-Length` value and the Node.js HTTP parser has been brought into line on this particular difference. The security risk of this flaw to Node.js users is considered to be VERY LOW as it is difficult, and may be impossible, to craft an attack that makes use of this flaw in a way that could not already be achieved by supplying an incorrect value for `Content-Length`. Vulnerabilities may exist in user-code that make incorrect assumptions about the potential accuracy of this value compared to the actual length of the data supplied.

Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":3.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":3.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2018-1000030","epss":0.00774,"percentile":0.72559,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":""},"advisories":[],"risk":0.25155},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"2.7.12"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-1000030","versionConstraint":"<= 2.7.14 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}}],"artifact":{"id":"74dc27ec36c075ab","name":"python","version":"2.7.12","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/python2.7","accessPath":"/usr/bin/python2.7","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@2.7.12","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-9qj9-36jm-prpv","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9qj9-36jm-prpv","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Regular Expression Denial of Service in fresh","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2017-16119","epss":0.00328,"percentile":0.55157,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.5.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.246},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2017-16119","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16119","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/526","https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/526"],"description":"Fresh is a module used by the Express.js framework for HTTP response freshness testing.

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer.

SSLSocket.)","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-40217","epss":0.00284,"percentile":0.51657,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.8.18","3.9.18","3.10.13","3.11.5"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.14626},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"2.7.12"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-40217","versionConstraint":"<

NPM package `micromatch` prior to 4.0.8 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persists. This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to greedy matching.

issue was discovered in Python before 3.11.1. An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-45061","epss":0.0008,"percentile":0.24664,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.7.16","3.8.16","3.9.16","3.10.9","3.11.1","3.12.0a3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.060000000000000005},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"2.7.12"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-45061","versionConstraint":"<

The email package is intended to have size limits and to throw an exception when limits are exceeded; they were exceeded by the example demonstration code.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-36632","epss":0.0003,"percentile":0.0708,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":""},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0225},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"2.7.12"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-36632","versionConstraint":"<= 3.11.4 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}}],"artifact":{"id":"74dc27ec36c075ab","name":"python","version":"2.7.12","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/python2.7","accessPath":"/usr/bin/python2.7","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:2.7.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@2.7.12","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-23167","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23167","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/may-2025-security-releases"],"description":"A flaw in Node.js 20's HTTP parser allows improper termination of HTTP/1 headers using `\\r\\n\\rX` instead of the required `\\r\\n\\r\\n`.\nThis inconsistency enables request smuggling, allowing attackers to bypass proxy-based access controls and submit unauthorized requests.\n\nThe issue was resolved by upgrading `llhttp` to version 9, which enforces correct header termination.\n\nImpact:\n* This vulnerability affects only Node.js 20.x users prior to the `llhttp` v9 upgrade.","cvss":[{"source":"support@hackerone.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-23167","epss":0.00039,"percentile":0.11057,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["20.19.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.022424999999999997},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:4.4.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"4.4.4"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-23167","versionConstraint":"< 20.19.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"20.19.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"5acbfb099df84906","name":"node","version":"4.4.4","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/node","accessPath":"/bin/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:4.4.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/node@4.4.4","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-cm22-4g7w-348p","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cm22-4g7w-348p","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"serve-static vulnerable to template injection that can lead to XSS","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-43800","epss":0.00052,"percentile":0.16097,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.16.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0208},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-43800","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43800","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/expressjs/serve-static/commit/0c11fad159898cdc69fd9ab63269b72468ecaf6b","https://github.com/expressjs/serve-static/commit/ce730896fddce1588111d9ef6fdf20896de5c6fa","https://github.com/expressjs/serve-static/security/advisories/GHSA-cm22-4g7w-348p"],"description":"serve-static serves static files. serve-static passes untrusted user input - even after sanitizing it - to redirect() may execute untrusted code.
