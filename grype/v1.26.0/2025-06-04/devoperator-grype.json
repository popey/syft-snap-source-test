SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC).

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed.

Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45337","epss":0.36067,"percentile":0.9691,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.0.0-20200414173820-0848c9571904"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.31.0 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v778-237x-gjrc"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.31.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"1f3c89e97aef0022","name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.0.0-20200414173820-0848c9571904","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/istioctl","accessPath":"/istioctl","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:go:ssh:v0.0.0-20200414173820-0848c9571904:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/crypto@v0.0.0-20200414173820-0848c9571904","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.14.7","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:bXoxMPcSLOq08zI3/c5dEBT6lE4eh+jOh886GHrn6V8=","mainModule":"istio.io/istio"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-7fxm-f474-hf8w","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7fxm-f474-hf8w","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Kubernetes privilege escalation vulnerability","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-3676","epss":0.35598,"percentile":0.96879,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.24.17"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":29.012370000000004},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-3676","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3676","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/119339","https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-security-announce/c/d_fvHZ9a5zc","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231130-0007/","https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/119339","https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-security-announce/c/d_fvHZ9a5zc","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231130-0007/"],"description":"A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where a user\n that can create pods on Windows nodes may be able to escalate to admin \nprivileges on those nodes.

is a HTTP library. Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12.

is the instrumentation library for Go applications in Prometheus, and the promhttp package in client_golang provides tooling around HTTP servers and clients. In client_golang prior to version 1.11.1, HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an instrumented software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except `RequestsInFlight`; not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware; pass metric with `method` label name to our middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown `method`. client_golang version 1.11.1 contains a patch for this issue. Several workarounds are available, including removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp handlers; adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request method given by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy or web application firewall, configured to only allow a limited set of methods.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-21698","epss":0.00227,"percentile":0.45732,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/prometheus/client_golang","version":"v0.9.4"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.11.1

is the instrumentation library for Go applications in Prometheus, and the promhttp package in client_golang provides tooling around HTTP servers and clients. In client_golang prior to version 1.11.1, HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an instrumented software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except `RequestsInFlight`; not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware; pass metric with `method` label name to our middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown `method`. client_golang version 1.11.1 contains a patch for this issue. Several workarounds are available, including removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp handlers; adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request method given by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy or web application firewall, configured to only allow a limited set of methods.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-21698","epss":0.00227,"percentile":0.45732,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/prometheus/client_golang","version":"v1.2.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.11.1

Versions prior to 3.14.2 contain an uninitialized variable vulnerability when Helm parses index and plugin yaml files missing expected content. When either an `index.yaml` file or a plugins `plugin.yaml` file were missing all metadata a panic would occur in Helm. In the Helm SDK, this is found when using the `LoadIndexFile` or `DownloadIndexFile` functions in the `repo` package or the `LoadDir` function in the `plugin` package. For the Helm client this impacts functions around adding a repository and all Helm functions if a malicious plugin is added as Helm inspects all known plugins on each invocation. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.14.2. If a malicious plugin has been added which is causing all Helm client commands to panic, the malicious plugin can be manually removed from the filesystem. If using Helm SDK versions prior to 3.14.2, calls to affected functions can use `recover` to catch the panic.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-26147","epss":0.00217,"percentile":0.44596,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"helm.sh/helm/v3","version":"v3.2.4"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<3.14.2

Each such request leaves the proxy with an invalid connection, and causes one subsequent request using that connection to fail.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-24791","epss":0.002,"percentile":0.42771,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.21.12","1.22.5"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.15},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.14.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.14.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-24791","versionConstraint":"< 1.21.12,>= 1.22.0-0, < 1.22.5 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.21.12"}}],"artifact":{"id":"8ff7149929c98cf2","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.14.7","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/istioctl","accessPath":"/istioctl","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.14.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.14.7","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.14.7","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-40217","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40217","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00022.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00017.html","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce%40python.org/thread/PEPLII27KYHLF4AK3ZQGKYNCRERG4YXY/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0014/","https://www.python.org/dev/security/","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00022.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00017.html","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce%40python.org/thread/PEPLII27KYHLF4AK3ZQGKYNCRERG4YXY/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0014/","https://www.python.org/dev/security/"],"description":"An issue was discovered in Python before 3.8.18, 3.9.x before 3.9.18, 3.10.x before 3.10.13, and 3.11.x before 3.11.5. It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-40217","epss":0.00284,"percentile":0.51657,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.8.18","3.9.18","3.10.13","3.11.5"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.14626},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.6.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.9"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-40217","versionConstraint":"< 3.8.18,>= 3.10.0, < 3.10.13,>= 3.11.0, < 3.11.5,>= 3.9.0, < 3.9.18 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.8.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ca444138f2460464","name":"python","version":"3.6.9","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/python3.6","accessPath":"/usr/bin/python3.6","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:3.6.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.6.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@3.6.9","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2020-8315","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8315","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://bugs.python.org/issue39401","https://bugs.python.org/issue39401"],"description":"In Python (CPython) 3.6 through 3.6.10, 3.7 through 3.7.6, and 3.8 through 3.8.1, an insecure dependency load upon launch on Windows 7 may result in an attacker's copy of api-ms-win-core-path-l1-1-0.dll being loaded and used instead of the system's copy.

Path Traversal \"Zip Slip\" vulnerability has been identified in mholt/archiver in Go. This vulnerability allows using a crafted ZIP file containing path traversal symlinks to create or overwrite files with the user's privileges or application utilizing the library.\n\nWhen using the archiver.Unarchive functionality with ZIP files, like this: archiver.Unarchive(zipFile, outputDir),  A crafted ZIP file can be extracted in such a way that it writes files to the affected system with the same privileges as the application executing this vulnerable functionality. Consequently, sensitive files may be overwritten, potentially leading to privilege escalation, code execution, and other severe outcomes in some cases.\n\nIt's worth noting that a similar vulnerability was found in TAR files (CVE-2024-0406). Although a fix was implemented, it hasn't been officially released, and the affected project has since been deprecated. The successor to mholt/archiver is a new project called mholt/archives, and its initial release (v0.1.0) removes the Unarchive() functionality.","cvss":[{"source":"reefs@jfrog.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.3},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-3445","epss":0.0013,"percentile":0.33898,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/mholt/archiver","version":"v3.1.1+incompatible"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<=3.5.1 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-7vpp-9cxj-q8gv"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a4a64c849993aae1","name":"github.com/mholt/archiver","version":"v3.1.1+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/istioctl","accessPath":"/istioctl","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:mholt:archiver:v3.1.1+incompatible:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/mholt/archiver@v3.1.1%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.14.7","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:1dCVxuqs0dJseYEhi5pl7MYPH9zDa1wBi7mF09cbNkU=","mainModule":"istio.io/istio"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-74j8-88mm-7496","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-74j8-88mm-7496","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Confused Deputy in Kubernetes","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-8561","epss":0.00219,"percentile":0.44903,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.09964499999999998},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2020-8561","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8561","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/104720","https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-security-announce/c/RV2IhwcrQsY","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211014-0002/","https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/104720","https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-security-announce/c/RV2IhwcrQsY","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211014-0002/"],"description":"A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where actors that control the responses of MutatingWebhookConfiguration or ValidatingWebhookConfiguration requests are able to redirect kube-apiserver requests to private networks of the apiserver.

Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. In Helm from version 3.0 and before version 3.5.2, there a few cases where data loaded from potentially untrusted sources was not properly sanitized. When a SemVer in the `version` field of a chart is invalid, in some cases Helm allows the string to be used \"as is\" without sanitizing. Helm fails to properly sanitized some fields present on Helm repository `index.yaml` files. Helm does not properly sanitized some fields in the `plugin.yaml` file for plugins In some cases, Helm does not properly sanitize the fields in the `Chart.yaml` file. By exploiting these attack vectors, core maintainers were able to send deceptive information to a terminal screen running the `helm` command, as well as obscure or alter information on the screen. In some cases, we could send codes that terminals used to execute higher-order logic, like clearing a terminal screen. Further, during evaluation, the Helm maintainers discovered a few other fields that were not properly sanitized when read out of repository index files. This fix remedies all such cases, and once again enforces SemVer2 policies on version fields. All users of the Helm 3 should upgrade to the fixed version 3.5.2 or later. Those who use Helm as a library should verify that they either sanitize this data on their own, or use the proper Helm API calls to sanitize the data.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.5,"exploitabilityScore":6.9,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":1.5,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-21303","epss":0.00168,"percentile":0.38985,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"helm.sh/helm/v3","version":"v3.2.4"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=3.0.0,<3.5.2

If a repository is compromised, this lowers the level of access that an attacker needs to inject a bad chart into a repository. To perform this attack, an attacker must have write access to the index file (which can occur during a MITM attack on a non-SSL connection). This issue has been patched in Helm 3.3.2 and 2.16.11.

A possible workaround is to manually review the `dependencies` field of any untrusted chart, verifying that the `alias` field is either not used, or (if used) does not contain newlines or path characters.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.7,"exploitabilityScore":1.3,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4,"exploitabilityScore":8,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.7,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-15184","epss":0.00234,"percentile":0.46408,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"helm.sh/helm/v3","version":"v3.2.4"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=3.0.0,<3.3.2 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-9vp5-m38w-j776"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.3.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"4385c4ea55f4a3e7","name":"helm.sh/helm/v3","version":"v3.2.4","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/istioctl","accessPath":"/istioctl","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:helm:v3:v3.2.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/helm.sh/helm/v3@v3.2.4","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.14.7","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:lz/0ZRkSgyIF+pCo6pjFzap1udCARB1IN6CRfqkpcOg=","mainModule":"istio.io/istio"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-11168","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-11168","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/29f348e232e82938ba2165843c448c2b291504c5","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/634ded45545ce8cbd6fd5d49785613dd7fa9b89e","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/b2171a2fd41416cf68afd67460578631d755a550","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/ddca2953191c67a12b1f19d6bca41016c6ae7132","https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103848","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/103849","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/XPWB6XVZ5G5KGEI63M4AWLIEUF5BPH4T/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250411-0004/"],"description":"The urllib.parse.urlsplit() and urlparse() functions improperly validated bracketed hosts (`[]`), allowing hosts that weren't IPv6 or IPvFuture.

For example, a malicious chart could inject `getHostByName` into a chart in order to disclose values to a malicious DNS server. The issue has been fixed in Helm 3.11.1.

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20200226121028-0de0cce0169b"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20200520004742-59133d7f0dd7"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20200602114024-627f9648deb9"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.17.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"94a1bf418b802deb","name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20200602114024-627f9648deb9","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/istioctl","accessPath":"/istioctl","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:networking:v0.0.0-20200602114024-627f9648deb9:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/net@v0.0.0-20200602114024-627f9648deb9","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.14.7","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:pNX+40auqi2JqRfOP1akLGtYcn15TUbkhwuCO3foqqM=","mainModule":"istio.io/istio"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-q2x7-8rv6-6q7h","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q2x7-8rv6-6q7h","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Jinja has a sandbox breakout through indirect reference to format method","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-56326","epss":0.00103,"percentile":0.29452,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.1.5"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.06592},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-56326","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56326","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/pallets/jinja/commit/48b0687e05a5466a91cd5812d604fa37ad0943b4","https://github.com/pallets/jinja/releases/tag/3.1.5","https://github.com/pallets/jinja/security/advisories/GHSA-q2x7-8rv6-6q7h"],"description":"Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.5, An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to store a reference to a malicious string's format method, then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja, but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox.

issue was discovered in Python before 3.11.1. An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302.

is an extensible templating engine. Special placeholders in the template allow writing code similar to Python syntax. It is possible to inject arbitrary HTML attributes into the rendered HTML template, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The Jinja `xmlattr` filter can be abused to inject arbitrary HTML attribute keys and values, bypassing the auto escaping mechanism and potentially leading to XSS. It may also be possible to bypass attribute validation checks if they are blacklist-based.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-22195","epss":0.00102,"percentile":0.29275,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"jinja2","version":"2.11.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<3.1.3 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-h5c8-rqwp-cp95"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.1.3"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ff51cb939eace7e8","name":"jinja2","version":"2.11.2","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.6/site-packages/Jinja2-2.11.2.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.6/site-packages/Jinja2-2.11.2.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.6/site-packages/Jinja2-2.11.2.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.6/site-packages/Jinja2-2.11.2.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher_project:python-jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher_project:python_jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacherproject:python-jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacherproject:python_jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher_project:jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin-ronacher:python-jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin-ronacher:python_jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher:python-jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher:python_jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacherproject:jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-jinja2:python-jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-jinja2:python_jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_jinja2:python-jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_jinja2:python_jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin-ronacher:jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher:jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jinja2:python-jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jinja2:python_jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-jinja2:jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python-jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python_jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_jinja2:jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jinja2:jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:jinja2:2.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/jinja2@2.11.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-29923","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29923","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://defcon.org/html/defcon-29/dc-29-speakers.html#kaoudis","https://github.com/golang/go/issues/30999","https://github.com/golang/go/issues/43389","https://github.com/sickcodes/security/blob/master/advisories/SICK-2021-016.md","https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/325829/","https://golang.org/pkg/net/#ParseCIDR","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4CHKSFMHZVOBCZSSVRE3UEYNKARTBMTM/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-02","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html","https://defcon.org/html/defcon-29/dc-29-speakers.html#kaoudis","https://github.com/golang/go/issues/30999","https://github.com/golang/go/issues/43389","https://github.com/sickcodes/security/blob/master/advisories/SICK-2021-016.md","https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/325829/","https://golang.org/pkg/net/#ParseCIDR","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4CHKSFMHZVOBCZSSVRE3UEYNKARTBMTM/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-02","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html"],"description":"Go before 1.17 does not properly consider extraneous zero characters at the beginning of an IP address octet, which (in some situations) allows attackers to bypass access control that is based on IP addresses, because of unexpected octal interpretation.

The `xmlattr` filter in affected versions of Jinja accepts keys containing non-attribute characters. XML/HTML attributes cannot contain spaces, `/`, `>`, or `=`, as each would then be interpreted as starting a separate attribute. If an application accepts keys (as opposed to only values) as user input, and renders these in pages that other users see as well, an attacker could use this to inject other attributes and perform XSS. The fix for CVE-2024-22195 only addressed spaces but not other characters. Accepting keys as user input is now explicitly considered an unintended use case of the `xmlattr` filter, and code that does so without otherwise validating the input should be flagged as insecure, regardless of Jinja version. Accepting _values_ as user input continues to be safe.

and MIME header parsing can allocate large amounts of memory, even when parsing small inputs, potentially leading to a denial of service.

Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45803","epss":0.00062,"percentile":0.1968,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"1.25.11"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=0,<1.26.18 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.26.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"52b7862c39e80b33","name":"urllib3","version":"1.25.11","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.6/site-packages/urllib3-1.25.11.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.6/site-packages/urllib3-1.25.11.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.6/site-packages/urllib3-1.25.11.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.6/site-packages/urllib3-1.25.11.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:urllib3:1.25.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/urllib3@1.25.11","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-7hfp-qfw3-5jxh","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7hfp-qfw3-5jxh","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Helm Vulnerable to denial of service through string value parsing","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-36055","epss":0.00049,"percentile":0.15182,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.9.4"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.028175},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-36055","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36055","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.9.4","https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-7hfp-qfw3-5jxh","https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.9.4","https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-7hfp-qfw3-5jxh"],"description":"Helm is a tool for managing Charts.

Some string inputs can cause array data structures to be created causing an out of memory panic. Applications that use the _strvals_ package in the Helm SDK to parse user supplied input can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from. The Helm Client will panic with input to `--set`, `--set-string`, and other value setting flags that causes an out of memory panic. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm client. This issue has been resolved in 3.9.4.

Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the jaraco/zipp library, affecting all versions prior to 3.19.1. The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted zip file that leads to an infinite loop. This issue also impacts the zipfile module of CPython, as features from the third-party zipp library are later merged into CPython, and the affected code is identical in both projects. The infinite loop can be initiated through the use of functions affecting the `Path` module in both zipp and zipfile, such as `joinpath`, the overloaded division operator, and `iterdir`. Although the infinite loop is not resource exhaustive, it prevents the application from responding.

is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.6, an oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment interacts with the |attr filter allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to use the |attr filter to get a reference to a string's plain format method, bypassing the sandbox. After the fix, the |attr filter no longer bypasses the environment's attribute lookup.

When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not user the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigations.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37891","epss":0.00033,"percentile":0.08049,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"1.25.11"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.26.19

Windows a directory returned by tempfile.mkdtemp() would not always have permissions set to restrict reading and writing to the temporary directory by other users, instead usually inheriting the correct permissions from the default location. Alternate configurations or users without a profile directory may not have the intended permissions.\n\nIf you’re not using Windows or haven’t changed the temporary directory location then you aren’t affected by this vulnerability. On other platforms the returned directory is consistently readable and writable only by the current user.\n\nThis issue was caused by Python not supporting Unix permissions on Windows. The fix adds support for Unix “700” for the mkdir function on Windows which is used by mkdtemp() to ensure the newly created directory has the proper permissions.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4030","epss":0.00014,"percentile":0.01528,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.8.20","3.9.20","3.10.15","3.11.10","3.12.4","3.13.0b1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.01022},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.6.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.9"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-4030","versionConstraint":"< 3.8.20,>= 3.10.0, < 3.10.15,>= 3.11.0, < 3.11.10,>= 3.12.0, < 3.12.4,>= 3.13.0a1, < 3.13.0b1,>= 3.9.0, < 3.9.20 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.8.20"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ca444138f2460464","name":"python","version":"3.6.9","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/python3.6","accessPath":"/usr/bin/python3.6","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:3.6.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.6.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@3.6.9","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-4516","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4516","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/4398b788ffc1f954a2c552da285477d42a571292","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/6279eb8c076d89d3739a6edb393e43c7929b429d","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/69b4387f78f413e8c47572a85b3478c47eba8142","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/73b3040f592436385007918887b7e2132aa8431f","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/8d35fd1b34935221aff23a1ab69a429dd156be77","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/9f69a58623bd01349a18ba0c7a9cb1dad6a51e8e","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/ab9893c40609935e0d40a6d2a7307ea51aec598b","https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/133767","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/129648","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/L75IPBBTSCYEF56I2M4KIW353BB3AY74/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/05/16/4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/05/19/1"],"description":"There is an issue in CPython when using `bytes.decode(\"unicode_escape\", error=\"ignore|replace\")`.

mitigations to a report from 2019 and CVE-2020-8555, Kubernetes attempts to prevent proxied connections from accessing link-local or localhost networks when making user-driven connections to Services, Pods, Nodes, or StorageClass service providers. As part of this mitigation Kubernetes does a DNS name resolution check and validates that response IPs are not in the link-local (169.254.0.0/16) or localhost (127.0.0.0/8) range. Kubernetes then performs a second DNS resolution without validation for the actual connection. If a non-standard DNS server returns different non-cached responses, a user may be able to bypass the proxy IP restriction and access private networks on the control plane.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.5,"exploitabilityScore":6.9,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"jordan@liggitt.net","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-8562","epss":0.0003,"percentile":0.06917,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"k8s.io/kubernetes","version":"v1.16.8"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<=1.18.19
