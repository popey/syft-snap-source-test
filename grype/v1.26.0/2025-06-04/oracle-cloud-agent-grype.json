SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed.

This may bypass any policy-based enforcement on container setup (including a Kubernetes Pod Security Policy) and expose potentially sensitive information. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd’s CRI implementation. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.1, 1.5.10, and 1.4.12.

A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.\n\nUsing a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.\n\nA security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.\n\nDocker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.\n\ndocker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability.

The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in `dockerd` and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code.\n\nThe `overlay` network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with the VXLAN metadata, including a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the `u32` iptables extension provided by the `xt_u32` kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nAn iptables rule designates outgoing VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted overlay network for IPsec encapsulation.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks on affected platforms silently transmit unencrypted data. As a result, `overlay` networks may appear to be functional, passing traffic as expected, but without any of the expected confidentiality or data integrity guarantees.\n\nIt is possible for an attacker sitting in a trusted position on the network to read all of the application traffic that is moving across the overlay network, resulting in unexpected secrets or user data disclosure. Thus, because many database protocols, internal APIs, etc. are not protected by a second layer of encryption, a user may use Swarm encrypted overlay networks to provide confidentiality, which due to this vulnerability this is no longer guaranteed.\n\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3, and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Close the VXLAN port (by default, UDP port 4789) to outgoing traffic at the Internet boundary in order to prevent unintentionally leaking unencrypted traffic over the Internet, and/or ensure that the `xt_u32` kernel module is available on all nodes of the Swarm cluster.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28841","epss":0.02777,"percentile":0.85393,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.12+incompatible"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=1.12.0,<20.10.24 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-33pg-m6jh-5237"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"20.10.24"}}],"artifact":{"id":"6a6b248c5b359937","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.12+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/vss-tools","accessPath":"/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/vss-tools","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v20.10.12+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v20.10.12%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.5","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:CEeNmFM0QZIsJCZKMkZx0ZcahTiewkrgiwfYD+dfl1U=","mainModule":"oracle-cloud-agent/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/tools"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-24784","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24784","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/555596","https://go.dev/issue/65083","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2609","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0007/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/555596","https://go.dev/issue/65083","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2609","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0007/"],"description":"The ParseAddressList function incorrectly handles comments (text within parentheses) within display names.

is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby, is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in dockerd and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code.\n\nThe overlay network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the u32 iptables extension provided by the xt_u32 kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nTwo iptables rules serve to filter incoming VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted network and discards unencrypted datagrams. The rules are appended to the end of the INPUT filter chain, following any rules that have been previously set by the system administrator. Administrator-set rules take precedence over the rules Moby sets to discard unencrypted VXLAN datagrams, which can potentially admit unencrypted datagrams that should have been discarded.\n\nThe injection of arbitrary Ethernet frames can enable a Denial of Service attack. A sophisticated attacker may be able to establish a UDP or TCP connection by way of the container’s outbound gateway that would otherwise be blocked by a stateful firewall, or carry out other escalations beyond simple injection by smuggling packets into the overlay network.\n\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3 and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Close the VXLAN port (by default, UDP port 4789) to incoming traffic at the Internet boundary to prevent all VXLAN packet injection, and/or ensure that the `xt_u32` kernel module is available on all nodes of the Swarm cluster.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.7,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28840","epss":0.00425,"percentile":0.61402,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.12+incompatible"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=1.12.0,<20.10.24 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-232p-vwff-86mp"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"20.10.24"}}],"artifact":{"id":"6a6b248c5b359937","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.12+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/vss-tools","accessPath":"/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/vss-tools","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v20.10.12+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v20.10.12%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.5","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:CEeNmFM0QZIsJCZKMkZx0ZcahTiewkrgiwfYD+dfl1U=","mainModule":"oracle-cloud-agent/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/tools"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-6wrf-mxfj-pf5p","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6wrf-mxfj-pf5p","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Docker Swarm encrypted overlay network with a single endpoint is unauthenticated","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28842","epss":0.00403,"percentile":0.60095,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["20.10.24"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.23776999999999995},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-28842","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28842","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/moby/libnetwork/security/advisories/GHSA-gvm4-2qqg-m333","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-232p-vwff-86mp","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-33pg-m6jh-5237","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-6wrf-mxfj-pf5p","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LYZOKMMVX4SIEHPJW3SJUQGMO5YZCPHC/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XNF4OLYZRQE75EB5TW5N42FSXHBXGWFE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZTE4ITXXPIWZEQ4HYQCB6N6GZIMWXDAI/","https://github.com/moby/libnetwork/security/advisories/GHSA-gvm4-2qqg-m333","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-232p-vwff-86mp","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-33pg-m6jh-5237","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-6wrf-mxfj-pf5p","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LYZOKMMVX4SIEHPJW3SJUQGMO5YZCPHC/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XNF4OLYZRQE75EB5TW5N42FSXHBXGWFE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZTE4ITXXPIWZEQ4HYQCB6N6GZIMWXDAI/"],"description":"Moby) is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products.

Routes and encryption parameters are only defined for destination nodes that participate in the network. The iptables rules that prevent encrypted overlay networks from accepting unencrypted packets are not created until a peer is available with which to communicate.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks silently accept cleartext VXLAN datagrams that are tagged with the VNI of an encrypted overlay network. As a result, it is possible to inject arbitrary Ethernet frames into the encrypted overlay network by encapsulating them in VXLAN datagrams. The implications of this can be quite dire, and GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw should be referenced for a deeper exploration.\n\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3, and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\nSome workarounds are available. In multi-node clusters, deploy a global ‘pause’ container for each encrypted overlay network, on every node. For a single-node cluster, do not use overlay networks of any sort. Bridge networks provide the same connectivity on a single node and have no multi-node features. The Swarm ingress feature is implemented using an overlay network, but can be disabled by publishing ports in `host` mode instead of `ingress` mode (allowing the use of an external load balancer), and removing the `ingress` network. If encrypted overlay networks are in exclusive use, block UDP port 4789 from traffic that has not been validated by IPSec.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28842","epss":0.00403,"percentile":0.60095,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.12+incompatible"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=1.12.0,<20.10.24 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-6wrf-mxfj-pf5p"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"20.10.24"}}],"artifact":{"id":"6a6b248c5b359937","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.12+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/vss-tools","accessPath":"/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/vss-tools","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v20.10.12+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v20.10.12%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.5","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:CEeNmFM0QZIsJCZKMkZx0ZcahTiewkrgiwfYD+dfl1U=","mainModule":"oracle-cloud-agent/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/tools"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-24783","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24783","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/569339","https://go.dev/issue/65390","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2598","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0005/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/569339","https://go.dev/issue/65390","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2598","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0005/"],"description":"Verifying a certificate chain which contains a certificate with an unknown public key algorithm will cause Certificate.Verify to panic.

is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in containerd's CRI implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host. In the CRI stream server, a goroutine is launched to handle terminal resize events if a TTY is requested. If the user's process fails to launch due to, for example, a faulty command, the goroutine will be stuck waiting to send without a receiver, resulting in a memory leak. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation and the stream server is used for handling container IO. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.12 and 1.5.16.  Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used and that only trusted users have permissions to execute commands in running containers.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.7,"exploitabilityScore":2.1,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-23471","epss":0.00198,"percentile":0.42512,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","version":"v1.5.9"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.5.16 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-2qjp-425j-52j9"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.5.16"}}],"artifact":{"id":"21aec71674ed68a2","name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","version":"v1.5.9","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/vss-tools","accessPath":"/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/vss-tools","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:containerd:containerd:v1.5.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/containerd/containerd@v1.5.9","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.5","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:rs6Xg1gtIxaeyG+Smsb/0xaSDu1VgFhOCKBXxMxbsF4=","mainModule":"oracle-cloud-agent/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/tools"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-34156","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34156","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/611239","https://go.dev/issue/69139","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/S9POB9NCTdk","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-3106","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240926-0004/"],"description":"Calling Decoder.Decode on a message which contains deeply nested structures can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

This vulnerability allows using a crafted ZIP file containing path traversal symlinks to create or overwrite files with the user's privileges or application utilizing the library.\n\nWhen using the archiver.Unarchive functionality with ZIP files, like this: archiver.Unarchive(zipFile, outputDir),  A crafted ZIP file can be extracted in such a way that it writes files to the affected system with the same privileges as the application executing this vulnerable functionality. Consequently, sensitive files may be overwritten, potentially leading to privilege escalation, code execution, and other severe outcomes in some cases.\n\nIt's worth noting that a similar vulnerability was found in TAR files (CVE-2024-0406). Although a fix was implemented, it hasn't been officially released, and the affected project has since been deprecated. The successor to mholt/archiver is a new project called mholt/archives, and its initial release (v0.1.0) removes the Unarchive() functionality.","cvss":[{"source":"reefs@jfrog.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.3},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-3445","epss":0.0013,"percentile":0.33898,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/mholt/archiver/v3","version":"v3.5.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<=3.5.1

is an open source container framework that is a key component of Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. Moby's networking implementation allows for many networks, each with their own IP address range and gateway, to be defined. This feature is frequently referred to as custom networks, as each network can have a different driver, set of parameters and thus behaviors. When creating a network, the `--internal` flag is used to designate a network as _internal_. The `internal` attribute in a docker-compose.yml file may also be used to mark a network _internal_, and other API clients may specify the `internal` parameter as well.\n\nWhen containers with networking are created, they are assigned unique network interfaces and IP addresses. The host serves as a router for non-internal networks, with a gateway IP that provides SNAT/DNAT to/from container IPs.\n\nContainers on an internal network may communicate between each other, but are precluded from communicating with any networks the host has access to (LAN or WAN) as no default route is configured, and firewall rules are set up to drop all outgoing traffic. Communication with the gateway IP address (and thus appropriately configured host services) is possible, and the host may communicate with any container IP directly.\n\nIn addition to configuring the Linux kernel's various networking features to enable container networking, `dockerd` directly provides some services to container networks. Principal among these is serving as a resolver, enabling service discovery, and resolution of names from an upstream resolver.\n\nWhen a DNS request for a name that does not correspond to a container is received, the request is forwarded to the configured upstream resolver. This request is made from the container's network namespace: the level of access and routing of traffic is the same as if the request was made by the container itself.\n\nAs a consequence of this design, containers solely attached to an internal network will be unable to resolve names using the upstream resolver, as the container itself is unable to communicate with that nameserver. Only the names of containers also attached to the internal network are able to be resolved.\n\nMany systems run a local forwarding DNS resolver. As the host and any containers have separate loopback devices, a consequence of the design described above is that containers are unable to resolve names from the host's configured resolver, as they cannot reach these addresses on the host loopback device. To bridge this gap, and to allow containers to properly resolve names even when a local forwarding resolver is used on a loopback address, `dockerd` detects this scenario and instead forward DNS requests from the host namework namespace. The loopback resolver then forwards the requests to its configured upstream resolvers, as expected.\n\nBecause `dockerd` forwards DNS requests to the host loopback device, bypassing the container network namespace's normal routing semantics entirely, internal networks can unexpectedly forward DNS requests to an external nameserver. By registering a domain for which they control the authoritative nameservers, an attacker could arrange for a compromised container to exfiltrate data by encoding it in DNS queries that will eventually be answered by their nameservers.\n\nDocker Desktop is not affected, as Docker Desktop always runs an internal resolver on a RFC 1918 address.\n\nMoby releases 26.0.0, 25.0.4, and 23.0.11 are patched to prevent forwarding any DNS requests from internal networks. As a workaround, run containers intended to be solely attached to internal networks with a custom upstream address, which will force all upstream DNS queries to be resolved from the container's network namespace.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-29018","epss":0.00143,"percentile":0.35745,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.12+incompatible"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<23.0.11 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-mq39-4gv4-mvpx"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"23.0.11"}}],"artifact":{"id":"6a6b248c5b359937","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.12+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/vss-tools","accessPath":"/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/vss-tools","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v20.10.12+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v20.10.12%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.5","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:CEeNmFM0QZIsJCZKMkZx0ZcahTiewkrgiwfYD+dfl1U=","mainModule":"oracle-cloud-agent/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/tools"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-p782-xgp4-8hr8","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p782-xgp4-8hr8","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"golang.org/x/sys/unix has Incorrect privilege reporting in syscall","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-29526","epss":0.00149,"percentile":0.36633,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.0.0-20220412211240-33da011f77ad"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.076735},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-29526","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29526","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/golang/go/issues/52313","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Y5qrqw_lWdU","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Q6GE5EQGE4L2KRVGW4T75QVIYAXCLO5X/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RQXU752ALW53OJAF5MG3WMR5CCZVLWW6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z55VUVGO7E5PJFXIOVAY373NZRHBNCI5/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZY2SLWOQR4ZURQ7UBRZ7JIX6H6F5JHJR/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-02","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220729-0001/","https://github.com/golang/go/issues/52313","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Y5qrqw_lWdU","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Q6GE5EQGE4L2KRVGW4T75QVIYAXCLO5X/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RQXU752ALW53OJAF5MG3WMR5CCZVLWW6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z55VUVGO7E5PJFXIOVAY373NZRHBNCI5/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZY2SLWOQR4ZURQ7UBRZ7JIX6H6F5JHJR/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-02","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220729-0001/"],"description":"Go before 1.17.10 and 1.18.x before 1.18.2 has Incorrect Privilege Assignment.

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20190611141213-3f473d35a33a"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20190611141213-3f473d35a33a"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20190611141213-3f473d35a33a"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20190611141213-3f473d35a33a"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20190611141213-3f473d35a33a"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20190611141213-3f473d35a33a"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20190620200207-3b0461eec859"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20211112202133-69e39bad7dc2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.10.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.10.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.10.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.17.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"384e542f4eb481c2","name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.10.0","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/plugins/oci-hpc/oci-hpc-configure/oci-hpc-configure","accessPath":"/plugins/oci-hpc/oci-hpc-configure/oci-hpc-configure","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:networking:v0.10.0:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/net@v0.10.0","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.5","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:X2//UzNDwYmtCLn7To6G58Wr6f5ahEAQgKNzv9Y951M=","mainModule":"oracle-cloud-agent/plugins/oci-hpc/oci-hpc-configure"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-2mm7-x5h6-5pvq","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2mm7-x5h6-5pvq","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Moby (Docker Engine) started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-24769","epss":0.00111,"percentile":0.30664,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["20.10.14"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.06049500000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-24769","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24769","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/05/12/1","https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/2bbc786e4c59761d722d2d1518cd0a32829bc07f","https://github.com/moby/moby/releases/tag/v20.10.14","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-2mm7-x5h6-5pvq","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6PMQKCAPK2AR3DCYITJYMMNBEGQBGLCC/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A5AFKOQ5CE3CEIULWW4FLQKHFFU6FSYG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A5FQJ3MLFSEKQYCFPFZIKYGBXPZUJFVY/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FPOJUJZXGMIVKRS4QR75F6OIXNQ6LDBL/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HIMAHZ6AUIKN7AX26KHZYBXVECIOVWBH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HQCVS7WBFSTKJFNX5PGDRARMTOFWV2O7/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202401-31","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5162","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/05/12/1","https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/2bbc786e4c59761d722d2d1518cd0a32829bc07f","https://github.com/moby/moby/releases/tag/v20.10.14","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-2mm7-x5h6-5pvq","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6PMQKCAPK2AR3DCYITJYMMNBEGQBGLCC/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A5AFKOQ5CE3CEIULWW4FLQKHFFU6FSYG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A5FQJ3MLFSEKQYCFPFZIKYGBXPZUJFVY/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FPOJUJZXGMIVKRS4QR75F6OIXNQ6LDBL/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HIMAHZ6AUIKN7AX26KHZYBXVECIOVWBH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HQCVS7WBFSTKJFNX5PGDRARMTOFWV2O7/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202401-31","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5162"],"description":"Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted. This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset. This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. As a workaround, the entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.6,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-24769","epss":0.00111,"percentile":0.30664,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.12+incompatible"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<20.10.14 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-2mm7-x5h6-5pvq"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"20.10.14"}}],"artifact":{"id":"6a6b248c5b359937","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.12+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/vss-tools","accessPath":"/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/vss-tools","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v20.10.12+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v20.10.12%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.5","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:CEeNmFM0QZIsJCZKMkZx0ZcahTiewkrgiwfYD+dfl1U=","mainModule":"oracle-cloud-agent/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/tools"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-259w-8hf6-59c2","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-259w-8hf6-59c2","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"OCI image importer memory exhaustion in github.com/containerd/containerd","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-25153","epss":0.00115,"percentile":0.31419,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.5.18"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.060375},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-25153","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25153","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/0c314901076a74a7b797a545d2f462285fdbb8c4","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.5.18","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.6.18","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-259w-8hf6-59c2","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/0c314901076a74a7b797a545d2f462285fdbb8c4","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.5.18","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.6.18","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-259w-8hf6-59c2"],"description":"containerd is an open source container runtime.

Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. As a workaround, ensure that only trusted images are used and that only trusted users have permissions to import images.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.2,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-25153","epss":0.00115,"percentile":0.31419,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","version":"v1.5.9"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.5.18

is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in the containerd's CRI implementation where programs inside a container can cause the containerd daemon to consume memory without bound during invocation of the `ExecSync` API. This can cause containerd to consume all available memory on the computer, denying service to other legitimate workloads. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation; `ExecSync` may be used when running probes or when executing processes via an \"exec\" facility. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.6 and 1.5.13. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":2.1,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-31030","epss":0.00085,"percentile":0.25886,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","version":"v1.5.9"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.5.13 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-5ffw-gxpp-mxpf"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.5.13"}}],"artifact":{"id":"21aec71674ed68a2","name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","version":"v1.5.9","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/vss-tools","accessPath":"/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/vss-tools","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:containerd:containerd:v1.5.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/containerd/containerd@v1.5.9","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.5","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:rs6Xg1gtIxaeyG+Smsb/0xaSDu1VgFhOCKBXxMxbsF4=","mainModule":"oracle-cloud-agent/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/tools"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-2wrh-6pvc-2jm9","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2wrh-6pvc-2jm9","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Improper rendering of text nodes in golang.org/x/net/html","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-3978","epss":0.00078,"percentile":0.24378,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.13.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.043289999999999995},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-3978","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3978","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/514896","https://go.dev/issue/61615","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1988","https://go.dev/cl/514896","https://go.dev/issue/61615","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1988"],"description":"Text nodes not in the HTML namespace are incorrectly literally rendered, causing text which should be escaped to not be.

is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization. The classic builder cache system is prone to cache poisoning if the image is built FROM scratch. Also, changes to some instructions (most important being HEALTHCHECK and ONBUILD) would not cause a cache miss. An attacker with the knowledge of the Dockerfile someone is using could poison their cache by making them pull a specially crafted image that would be considered as a valid cache candidate for some build steps. 23.0+ users are only affected if they explicitly opted out of Buildkit (DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 environment variable) or are using the /build API endpoint. All users on versions older than 23.0 could be impacted. Image build API endpoint (/build) and ImageBuild function from github.com/docker/docker/client is also affected as it the uses classic builder by default. Patches are included in 24.0.9 and 25.0.2

is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where supplementary groups are not set up properly. If an attacker has direct access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group access, they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary group restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or gaining the ability to execute code in that container.  This bug is fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.18. Running containers should be stopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed. For users unable to upgrade, this problem can be worked around by not using the `\"USER $USERNAME\"` Dockerfile instruction. Instead by calling `ENTRYPOINT [\"su\", \"-\", \"user\"]` the supplementary groups will be set up properly.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":6.3,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-36109","epss":0.00044,"percentile":0.1312,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.12+incompatible"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<20.10.18 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-rc4r-wh2q-q6c4"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"20.10.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"6a6b248c5b359937","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.12+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/vss-tools","accessPath":"/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/vss-tools","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v20.10.12+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v20.10.12%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.5","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:CEeNmFM0QZIsJCZKMkZx0ZcahTiewkrgiwfYD+dfl1U=","mainModule":"oracle-cloud-agent/plugins/oci-vulnerabilityscan/tools"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-hpxr-w9w7-g4gv","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hpxr-w9w7-g4gv","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"stereoscope vulnerable to tar path traversal when processing OCI tar archives","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-24579","epss":0.00041,"percentile":0.11832,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.0.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.021115000000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-24579","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24579","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://github.com/anchore/stereoscope/commit/09dacab4d9ee65ee8bc7af8ebf4aa7b5aaa36204","https://github.com/anchore/stereoscope/security/advisories/GHSA-hpxr-w9w7-g4gv","https://github.com/anchore/stereoscope/commit/09dacab4d9ee65ee8bc7af8ebf4aa7b5aaa36204","https://github.com/anchore/stereoscope/security/advisories/GHSA-hpxr-w9w7-g4gv"],"description":"stereoscope is a go library for processing container images and simulating a squash filesystem.

A bug was found in containerd prior to versions 1.6.18 and 1.5.18 where supplementary groups are not set up properly inside a container. If an attacker has direct access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group access, they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary group restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or gaining the ability to execute code in that container. Downstream applications that use the containerd client library may be affected as well.\n\nThis bug has been fixed in containerd v1.6.18 and v.1.5.18. Users should update to these versions and recreate containers to resolve this issue. Users who rely on a downstream application that uses containerd's client library should check that application for a separate advisory and instructions. As a workaround, ensure that the `\"USER $USERNAME\"` Dockerfile instruction is not used. Instead, set the container entrypoint to a value similar to `ENTRYPOINT [\"su\", \"-\", \"user\"]` to allow `su` to properly set up supplementary groups.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-25173","epss":0.00022,"percentile":0.04464,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","version":"v1.5.9"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.5.18
