The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45337","epss":0.36067,"percentile":0.9691,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.28.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.31.0 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v778-237x-gjrc"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.31.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"3ad521289819cb9e","name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.28.0","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/kube-controller-manager","accessPath":"/kube-controller-manager","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:go:ssh:v0.28.0:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/crypto@v0.28.0","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.23.8","architecture":"amd64","mainModule":"k8s.io/kubernetes"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-8q59-q68h-6hv4","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8q59-q68h-6hv4","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Critical","urls":[],"description":"Improper Input Validation in PyYAML","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-14343","epss":0.14625,"percentile":0.94147,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["5.4"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":13.747500000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2020-14343","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14343","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1860466","https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/issues/2252","https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/420","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1860466","https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/issues/2252","https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/420","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"],"description":"A vulnerability was discovered in the PyYAML library in versions before 5.4, where it is susceptible to arbitrary code execution when it processes untrusted YAML files through the full_load method or with the FullLoader loader.

Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request.

is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 301, 302, or 303 after the request had its method changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs. Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45803","epss":0.00062,"percentile":0.1968,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"1.25.8"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=0,<1.26.18 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.26.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"26bbe87e6e558d9d","name":"urllib3","version":"1.25.8","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/urllib3-1.25.8.egg-info/PKG-INFO","accessPath":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/urllib3-1.25.8.egg-info/PKG-INFO","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/urllib3-1.25.8.egg-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/urllib3-1.25.8.egg-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:urllib3:1.25.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/urllib3@1.25.8","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-43fp-rhv2-5gv8","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-43fp-rhv2-5gv8","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Certifi removing TrustCor root certificate","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-23491","epss":0.00038,"percentile":0.10381,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["2022.12.07"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.02242},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-23491","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23491","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi/security/advisories/GHSA-43fp-rhv2-5gv8","https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy/c/oxX69KFvsm4/m/yLohoVqtCgAJ","https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi/security/advisories/GHSA-43fp-rhv2-5gv8","https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy/c/oxX69KFvsm4/m/yLohoVqtCgAJ","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230223-0010/"],"description":"Certifi is a curated collection of Root Certificates for validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity of TLS hosts.

When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3.
