Maven will follow repositories that are defined in a dependency’s Project Object Model (pom) which may be surprising to some users, resulting in potential risk if a malicious actor takes over that repository or is able to insert themselves into a position to pretend to be that repository.

serializes Java objects to XML and back again. Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":4.3},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41966","epss":0.05011,"percentile":0.89248,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"xstream","version":"1.4.10"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.4.20

vulnerability was found in Undertow. This vulnerability impacts a server that supports the wildfly-http-client protocol. Whenever a malicious user opens and closes a connection with the HTTP port of the server and then closes the connection immediately, the server will end with both memory and open file limits exhausted at some point, depending on the amount of memory available. \r\n\r\nAt HTTP upgrade to remoting, the WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit leaks connections if RemotingConnection is closed by Remoting ServerConnectionOpenListener. Because the remoting connection originates in Undertow as part of the HTTP upgrade, there is an external layer to the remoting connection. This connection is unaware of the outermost layer when closing the connection during the connection opening procedure.

This vulnerability impacts a server that supports the wildfly-http-client protocol. Whenever a malicious user opens and closes a connection with the HTTP port of the server and then closes the connection immediately, the server will end with both memory and open file limits exhausted at some point, depending on the amount of memory available. \r\n\r\nAt HTTP upgrade to remoting, the WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit leaks connections if RemotingConnection is closed by Remoting ServerConnectionOpenListener. Because the remoting connection originates in Undertow as part of the HTTP upgrade, there is an external layer to the remoting connection. This connection is unaware of the outermost layer when closing the connection during the connection opening procedure. Hence, the Undertow WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit is not notified of the closed connection in this scenario. Because WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit creates a timeout task, the whole dependency tree leaks via that task, which is added to XNIO WorkerThread. So, the workerThread points to the Undertow conduit, which contains the connections and causes the

File Overwrite in Eclipse JGit <= 6.6.0\n\nIn Eclipse JGit, all versions <= 6.6.0.202305301015-r, a symbolic link present in a specially crafted git repository can be used to write a file to locations outside the working tree when this repository is cloned with JGit to a case-insensitive filesystem, or when a checkout from a clone of such a repository is performed on a case-insensitive filesystem.\n\nThis can happen on checkout (DirCacheCheckout), merge (ResolveMerger via its WorkingTreeUpdater), pull (PullCommand using merge), and when applying a patch (PatchApplier). This can be exploited for remote code execution (RCE), for instance if the file written outside the working tree is a git filter that gets executed on a subsequent git command.\n\nThe issue occurs only on case-insensitive filesystems, like the default filesystems on Windows and macOS. The user performing the clone or checkout must have the rights to create symbolic links for the problem to occur, and symbolic links must be enabled in the git configuration.\n\nSetting git configuration option core.symlinks = false before checking out avoids the problem.\n\nThe issue was fixed in Eclipse JGit version 6.6.1.202309021850-r and 6.7.0.202309050840-r, available via  Maven Central https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jgit/  and  repo.eclipse.org https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/jgit-releases/ . A backport is available in 5.13.3 starting from  5.13.3.202401111512-r.\n\n\nThe JGit maintainers would like to thank RyotaK for finding and reporting this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"emo@eclipse.org","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4759","epss":0.01206,"percentile":0.7804,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"org.eclipse.jgit","version":"5.0.2.201807311906-r"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<5.13.3.202401111512-r (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3p86-9955-h393"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"5.13.3.202401111512-r"}}],"artifact":{"id":"c384f8364a353dbe","name":"org.eclipse.jgit","version":"5.0.2.201807311906-r","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/modules/system/layers/base/org/eclipse/jgit/main/org.eclipse.jgit-5.0.2.201807311906-r.jar","accessPath":"/modules/system/layers/base/org/eclipse/jgit/main/org.eclipse.jgit-5.0.2.201807311906-r.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:eclipse-org---jgit:org.eclipse.jgit:5.0.2.201807311906-r:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse_org___jgit:org.eclipse.jgit:5.0.2.201807311906-r:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.eclipse.jgit:org.eclipse.jgit:5.0.2.201807311906-r:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:org.eclipse.jgit:5.0.2.201807311906-r:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse-org---jgit:jgit:5.0.2.201807311906-r:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse_org___jgit:jgit:5.0.2.201807311906-r:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jgit:org.eclipse.jgit:5.0.2.201807311906-r:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.eclipse.jgit:jgit:5.0.2.201807311906-r:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jgit:5.0.2.201807311906-r:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jgit:jgit:5.0.2.201807311906-r:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/org.eclipse.jgit/org.eclipse.jgit@5.0.2.201807311906-r","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/modules/system/layers/base/org/eclipse/jgit/main/org.eclipse.jgit-5.0.2.201807311906-r.jar","pomArtifactID":"org.eclipse.jgit","pomGroupID":"org.eclipse.jgit","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"a81d7c8d153a8a744b6be1d9c6d698270beec1c0"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-xpp6-8r3j-ww43","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xpp6-8r3j-ww43","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Undertow Denial of Service vulnerability","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5971","epss":0.01253,"percentile":0.78428,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.2.34.Final"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.93975},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-5971","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5971","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4392","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4884","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:5143","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:5144","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:5145","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:5147","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6508","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6883","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-5971","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2292211","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4392","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4884","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-5971","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2292211","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240828-0001/"],"description":"A vulnerability was found in Undertow, where the chunked response hangs after the body was flushed.

If the non-default `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option is enabled, HTML including `javascript:` URLs that have been crafted with control characters will not be sanitized. If the site that this HTML is published on does not set a Content Security Policy, an XSS attack is then possible. This issue is patched in jsoup 1.15.3. Users should upgrade to this version. Additionally, as the unsanitized input may have been persisted, old content should be cleaned again using the updated version. To remediate this issue without immediately upgrading: - disable `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks`, which will rewrite input URLs as absolute URLs - ensure an appropriate [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is defined.

This means that an undetected man in the middle attack could be constructed if an attacker can arrange to intercept TLS traffic.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-0223","epss":0.00598,"percentile":0.68405,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"proton-j","version":"0.16.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=0.9,<0.27.1 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-5h6x-m52p-23ph"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.27.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"27e38a59049f8e09","name":"proton-j","version":"0.16.0","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/modules/system/layers/base/org/apache/qpid/proton/main/proton-j-0.16.0.jar","accessPath":"/modules/system/layers/base/org/apache/qpid/proton/main/proton-j-0.16.0.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":["http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:apache:proton-j:0.16.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:proton_j:0.16.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.qpid/proton-j@0.16.0","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/modules/system/layers/base/org/apache/qpid/proton/main/proton-j-0.16.0.jar","pomArtifactID":"proton-j","pomGroupID":"org.apache.qpid","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"689421e9d6d704d5d16446e039679c5ba27e1424"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-m5q8-58wh-xxq4","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m5q8-58wh-xxq4","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Drools Core Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-1415","epss":0.00751,"percentile":0.72093,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["7.69.0.Final"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.44309},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-1415","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1415","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:6813","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1415","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2065505","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:6813","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1415","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2065505"],"description":"A flaw was found where some utility classes in Drools core did not use proper safeguards when deserializing data.

This issue exists because of org.apache.commons.dbcp.datasources.SharedPoolDataSource and org.apache.commons.dbcp.datasources.PerUserPoolDataSource mishandling.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-16942","epss":0.00438,"percentile":0.62194,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"jackson-databind","version":"2.9.5"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=2.9.0,<2.9.10.1 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-mx7p-6679-8g3q"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.9.10.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ec298a6b41fc6eb3","name":"jackson-databind","version":"2.9.5","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/bin/client/keycloak-admin-cli-4.8.1.Final.jar","accessPath":"/bin/client/keycloak-admin-cli-4.8.1.Final.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson_databind:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:com.fasterxml.jackson:jackson-databind:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:com.fasterxml.jackson:jackson_databind:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jackson-databind:jackson-databind:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jackson-databind:jackson_databind:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jackson_databind:jackson-databind:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jackson_databind:jackson_databind:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:com.fasterxml.jackson:jackson:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fasterxml:jackson-databind:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fasterxml:jackson_databind:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jackson-databind:jackson:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jackson:jackson-databind:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jackson:jackson_databind:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jackson_databind:jackson:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:core:jackson-databind:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:core:jackson_databind:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fasterxml:jackson:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jackson:jackson:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:core:jackson:2.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-databind@2.9.5","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/bin/client/keycloak-admin-cli-4.8.1.Final.jar:com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind","pomArtifactID":"jackson-databind","pomGroupID":"com.fasterxml.jackson.core","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":null}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-m4fv-gm5m-4725","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m4fv-gm5m-4725","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"HTML Injection in Keycloak Admin REST API","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-1274","epss":0.00785,"percentile":0.7275,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["20.0.5"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.40819999999999995},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-1274","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1274","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2073157","https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/security/advisories/GHSA-m4fv-gm5m-4725","https://herolab.usd.de/security-advisories/usd-2021-0033/","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2073157","https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/security/advisories/GHSA-m4fv-gm5m-4725","https://herolab.usd.de/security-advisories/usd-2021-0033/"],"description":"A flaw was found in Keycloak in the execute-actions-email endpoint.

Unless a verification mode was explicitly configured, client and server modes previously defaulted as documented to not verifying a peer certificate, with options to configure this explicitly or select a certificate verification mode with or without hostname verification being performed. The latter hostname verifying mode was not implemented in Apache Qpid Proton-J versions 0.3 to 0.29.0, with attempts to use it resulting in an exception. This left only the option to verify the certificate is trusted, leaving such a client vulnerable to Man In The Middle (MITM) attack. Uses of the Proton-J protocol engine which do not utilise the optional transport TLS wrapper are not impacted, e.g. usage within Qpid JMS. Uses of Proton-J utilising the optional transport TLS wrapper layer that wish to enable hostname verification must be upgraded to version 0.30.0 or later and utilise the VerifyMode#VERIFY_PEER_NAME configuration, which is now the default for client mode usage unless configured otherwise.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2018-17187","epss":0.00517,"percentile":0.65786,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"proton-j","version":"0.16.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=0.3,<=0.29.0

is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In affected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream. A user is only affected if using the version out of the box with JDK 1.7u21 or below. However, this scenario can be adjusted easily to an external Xalan that works regardless of the version of the Java runtime. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general

The `SniHandler` can allocate up to 16MB of heap for each channel during the TLS handshake. When the handler or the channel does not have an idle timeout, it can be used to make a TCP server using the `SniHandler` to allocate 16MB of heap. The `SniHandler` class is a handler that waits for the TLS handshake to configure a `SslHandler` according to the indicated server name by the `ClientHello` record. For this matter it allocates a `ByteBuf` using the value defined in the `ClientHello` record. Normally the value of the packet should be smaller than the handshake packet but there are not checks done here and the way the code is written, it is possible to craft a packet that makes the `SslClientHelloHandler`.

The package `io.netty:netty-codec-http` prior to version 4.1.77.Final contains an insufficient fix for CVE-2021-21290. When Netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. This only impacts applications running on Java version 6 and lower. Additionally, this vulnerability impacts code running on Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all share the system temporary directory between all users. Version 4.1.77.Final contains a patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround, specify one's own `java.io.tmpdir` when starting the JVM or use DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...) to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":1.9,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-24823","epss":0.00285,"percentile":0.51712,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"netty-codec-http","version":"4.1.24.Final"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<=4.1.76.Final (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-269q-hmxg-m83q"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"4.1.77.Final"}}],"artifact":{"id":"85fa5b819a289a6d","name":"netty-codec-http","version":"4.1.24.Final","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/bin/client/jboss-client.jar","accessPath":"/bin/client/jboss-client.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:netty-codec-http:netty-codec-http:4.1.24.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-codec-http:netty_codec_http:4.1.24.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_codec_http:netty-codec-http:4.1.24.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_codec_http:netty_codec_http:4.1.24.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-codec:netty-codec-http:4.1.24.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-codec:netty_codec_http:4.1.24.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_codec:netty-codec-http:4.1.24.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_codec:netty_codec_http:4.1.24.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty:netty-codec-http:4.1.24.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty:netty_codec_http:4.1.24.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty:netty-codec-http:4.1.24.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty:netty_codec_http:4.1.24.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/io.netty/netty-codec-http@4.1.24.Final","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/bin/client/jboss-client.jar:io.netty:netty-codec-http","pomArtifactID":"netty-codec-http","pomGroupID":"io.netty","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":null}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-8vf3-4w62-m3pq","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8vf3-4w62-m3pq","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"XSS in Keycloak","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-1697","epss":0.00283,"percentile":0.51503,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["9.0.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.14716},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2020-1697","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1697","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-1697","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-1697"],"description":"It was found in all keycloak versions before 9.0.0 that links to external applications (Application Links) in the admin console are not validated properly and could allow Stored XSS attacks.

Additionally, it increases the attack surface because at any given time, two OTPs are valid.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-7318","epss":0.00257,"percentile":0.49152,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"keycloak-core","version":"4.8.1.Final"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<24.0.7 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-xmmm-jw76-q7vg"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"24.0.7"}}],"artifact":{"id":"5d8b6d015cd9ab22","name":"keycloak-core","version":"4.8.1.Final","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/modules/system/layers/keycloak/org/keycloak/keycloak-core/main/keycloak-core-4.8.1.Final.jar","accessPath":"/modules/system/layers/keycloak/org/keycloak/keycloak-core/main/keycloak-core-4.8.1.Final.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":["https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:org.keycloak.keycloak-core:keycloak-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.keycloak.keycloak-core:keycloak_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jboss-by-red-hat:keycloak-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jboss-by-red-hat:keycloak_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jboss_by_red_hat:keycloak-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jboss_by_red_hat:keycloak_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak-core:keycloak-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak-core:keycloak_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak_core:keycloak-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak_core:keycloak_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.keycloak:keycloak-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.keycloak:keycloak_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak:keycloak-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak:keycloak_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-core@4.8.1.Final","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/modules/system/layers/keycloak/org/keycloak/keycloak-core/main/keycloak-core-4.8.1.Final.jar","pomArtifactID":"keycloak-core","pomGroupID":"org.keycloak","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"2eef6b93014a580de4fdd0785737d0d0b83540a7"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-w33c-445m-f8w7","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w33c-445m-f8w7","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Okio Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error vulnerability","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-3635","epss":0.00222,"percentile":0.4513,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.17.6"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.12099000000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-3635","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3635","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/square/okio/commit/81bce1a30af244550b0324597720e4799281da7b","https://research.jfrog.com/vulnerabilities/okio-gzip-source-unhandled-exception-dos-xray-523195/","https://github.com/square/okio/commit/81bce1a30af244550b0324597720e4799281da7b","https://research.jfrog.com/vulnerabilities/okio-gzip-source-unhandled-exception-dos-xray-523195/"],"description":"GzipSource does not handle an exception that might be raised when parsing a malformed gzip buffer.

This behavior results in that a front-end proxy marking the backend worker (application server) as an error state and not forward requests to the worker for a while. In mod_cluster, this continues until the next STATUS request (10 seconds intervals) from the application server updates the server state. So, in the worst case, it can result in \"All workers are in error state\" and mod_cluster responds \"503 Service Unavailable\" for a while (up to 10 seconds). In mod_proxy_balancer, it does not forward requests to the worker until the \"retry\" timeout passes.

In mod_cluster, this continues until the next STATUS request (10 seconds intervals) from the application server updates the server state. So, in the worst case, it can result in \"All workers are in error state\" and mod_cluster responds \"503 Service Unavailable\" for a while (up to 10 seconds). In mod_proxy_balancer, it does not forward requests to the worker until the \"retry\" timeout passes.

This issue could result in a denial of service condition, preventing legitimate users from accessing the system.","cvss":[{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":4.9,"exploitabilityScore":1.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-2559","epss":0.00152,"percentile":0.37021,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"keycloak-services","version":"4.8.1.Final"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<=26.1.4 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-2935-2wfm-hhpv"}}],"artifact":{"id":"506841464a4ffaae","name":"keycloak-services","version":"4.8.1.Final","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/modules/system/layers/keycloak/org/keycloak/keycloak-services/main/keycloak-services-4.8.1.Final.jar","accessPath":"/modules/system/layers/keycloak/org/keycloak/keycloak-services/main/keycloak-services-4.8.1.Final.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:keycloak-services:keycloak-services:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak-services:keycloak_services:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak_services:keycloak-services:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak_services:keycloak_services:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jboss-by-red-hat:keycloak-services:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jboss-by-red-hat:keycloak_services:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jboss_by_red_hat:keycloak-services:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jboss_by_red_hat:keycloak_services:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.keycloak:keycloak-services:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.keycloak:keycloak_services:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak:keycloak-services:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak:keycloak_services:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-services@4.8.1.Final","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/modules/system/layers/keycloak/org/keycloak/keycloak-services/main/keycloak-services-4.8.1.Final.jar","pomArtifactID":"keycloak-services","pomGroupID":"org.keycloak","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"783c1821c0e2aa4815d814d2277cb236e9ce444c"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-gc7q-jgjv-vjr2","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gc7q-jgjv-vjr2","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Keycloak Services has a potential bypass of brute force protection","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4629","epss":0.0013,"percentile":0.33918,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["22.0.12"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.07474999999999998},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-4629","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-4629","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6493","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6494","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6495","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6497","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6499","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6500","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6501","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-4629","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2276761","https://github.com/hnsecurity/vulns/blob/main/HNS-2024-09-Keycloak.md","https://security.humanativaspa.it/an-analysis-of-the-keycloak-authentication-system/"],"description":"A vulnerability was found in Keycloak.

The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-3827","epss":0.00086,"percentile":0.26215,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"keycloak-saml-core","version":"4.8.1.Final"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<18.0.0 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4pc7-vqv5-5r3v"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"18.0.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"b2602f2a3916c695","name":"keycloak-saml-core","version":"4.8.1.Final","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/modules/system/layers/keycloak/org/keycloak/keycloak-saml-core/main/keycloak-saml-core-4.8.1.Final.jar","accessPath":"/modules/system/layers/keycloak/org/keycloak/keycloak-saml-core/main/keycloak-saml-core-4.8.1.Final.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:keycloak-saml-core:keycloak-saml-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak-saml-core:keycloak_saml_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak_saml_core:keycloak-saml-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak_saml_core:keycloak_saml_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jboss-by-red-hat:keycloak-saml-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jboss-by-red-hat:keycloak_saml_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jboss_by_red_hat:keycloak-saml-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jboss_by_red_hat:keycloak_saml_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak-saml:keycloak-saml-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak-saml:keycloak_saml_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak_saml:keycloak-saml-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak_saml:keycloak_saml_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.keycloak:keycloak-saml-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.keycloak:keycloak_saml_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak:keycloak-saml-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak:keycloak_saml_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-saml-core@4.8.1.Final","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/modules/system/layers/keycloak/org/keycloak/keycloak-saml-core/main/keycloak-saml-core-4.8.1.Final.jar","pomArtifactID":"keycloak-saml-core","pomGroupID":"org.keycloak","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"1d5c046a70be5096242a044a4f94f1ce811fcce5"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-3gg7-9q2x-79fc","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3gg7-9q2x-79fc","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames in Keycloak","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-1728","epss":0.00134,"percentile":0.34409,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.067},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2020-1728","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1728","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-1728","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-1728"],"description":"A vulnerability was found in all versions of Keycloak where, the pages on the Admin Console area of the application are completely missing general HTTP security headers in HTTP-responses.

A specially crafted URL can be constructed where the referrer and referrer_uri parameters are made to trick a user to visit a malicious webpage. A trusted URL can trick users and automation into believing that the URL is safe, when, in fact, it redirects to a malicious server. This issue can result in a victim inadvertently trusting the destination of the redirect, potentially leading to a successful phishing attack or other types of attacks.\r\n\r\nOnce a crafted URL is made, it can be sent to a Keycloak admin via email for example. This will trigger this vulnerability when the user visits the page and clicks the link. A malicious actor can use this to target users they know are Keycloak admins for further attacks. It may also be possible to bypass other domain-related security checks, such as supplying this as a OAuth redirect uri. The malicious actor can further obfuscate the redirect_uri using URL encoding, to hide the text of the actual malicious website domain.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-7260","epss":0.00115,"percentile":0.31364,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"keycloak-core","version":"4.8.1.Final"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<24.0.7 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-g4gc-rh26-m3p5"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"24.0.7"}}],"artifact":{"id":"5d8b6d015cd9ab22","name":"keycloak-core","version":"4.8.1.Final","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/modules/system/layers/keycloak/org/keycloak/keycloak-core/main/keycloak-core-4.8.1.Final.jar","accessPath":"/modules/system/layers/keycloak/org/keycloak/keycloak-core/main/keycloak-core-4.8.1.Final.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":["https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:org.keycloak.keycloak-core:keycloak-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.keycloak.keycloak-core:keycloak_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jboss-by-red-hat:keycloak-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jboss-by-red-hat:keycloak_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jboss_by_red_hat:keycloak-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jboss_by_red_hat:keycloak_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak-core:keycloak-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak-core:keycloak_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak_core:keycloak-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak_core:keycloak_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.keycloak:keycloak-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.keycloak:keycloak_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak:keycloak-core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak:keycloak_core:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-core@4.8.1.Final","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/modules/system/layers/keycloak/org/keycloak/keycloak-core/main/keycloak-core-4.8.1.Final.jar","pomArtifactID":"keycloak-core","pomGroupID":"org.keycloak","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"2eef6b93014a580de4fdd0785737d0d0b83540a7"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-xfrj-6vvc-3xm2","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xfrj-6vvc-3xm2","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Apache Santuario -

XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.8,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:C","metrics":{"baseScore":6.3,"exploitabilityScore":6.9,"impactScore":6.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-39140","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26738,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"xstream","version":"1.4.10"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.4.18 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-6wf9-jmg9-vxcc"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.4.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"f07c873d1b3dc9d8","name":"xstream","version":"1.4.10","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/modules/system/layers/keycloak/com/thoughtworks/xstream/main/xstream-1.4.10.jar","accessPath":"/modules/system/layers/keycloak/com/thoughtworks/xstream/main/xstream-1.4.10.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":["http://x-stream.github.io/license.html"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:com.thoughtworks.xstream:xstream:1.4.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:thoughtworks:xstream:1.4.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:xstream:xstream:1.4.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/com.thoughtworks.xstream/xstream@1.4.10","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/modules/system/layers/keycloak/com/thoughtworks/xstream/main/xstream-1.4.10.jar","pomArtifactID":"xstream","pomGroupID":"com.thoughtworks.xstream","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"dfecae23647abc9d9fd0416629a4213a3882b101"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-w88m-2936-rmxr","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w88m-2936-rmxr","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"wildfly-core allows user with access to management interface to access vault expression, retrieve item from vault","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-3644","epss":0.00162,"percentile":0.38192,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["16.0.1.Final"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.051029999999999985},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2021-3644","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3644","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Low","urls":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-3644","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1976052","https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-core/commit/06dd9884f6ba50470b1fb5a35198a8784f037714","https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-core/commit/6d8db43cd43b5994b7a14003db978064e086090b","https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-core/pull/4668","https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-5511","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-3644","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1976052","https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-core/commit/06dd9884f6ba50470b1fb5a35198a8784f037714","https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-core/commit/6d8db43cd43b5994b7a14003db978064e086090b","https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-core/pull/4668","https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-5511"],"description":"A flaw was found in wildfly-core in all versions.

As a consequence, an attacker who has compromised the admin console or compromised a user with sufficient privileges can leak domain credentials and attack the domain.","cvss":[{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.7,"exploitabilityScore":1.3,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5967","epss":0.00092,"percentile":0.27393,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"keycloak-ldap-federation","version":"4.8.1.Final"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<=22.0.11 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-c25h-c27q-5qpv"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"22.0.12"}}],"artifact":{"id":"70a46bda667f8820","name":"keycloak-ldap-federation","version":"4.8.1.Final","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/modules/system/layers/keycloak/org/keycloak/keycloak-ldap-federation/main/keycloak-ldap-federation-4.8.1.Final.jar","accessPath":"/modules/system/layers/keycloak/org/keycloak/keycloak-ldap-federation/main/keycloak-ldap-federation-4.8.1.Final.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:keycloak-ldap-federation:keycloak-ldap-federation:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak-ldap-federation:keycloak_ldap_federation:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak_ldap_federation:keycloak-ldap-federation:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak_ldap_federation:keycloak_ldap_federation:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jboss-by-red-hat:keycloak-ldap-federation:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jboss-by-red-hat:keycloak_ldap_federation:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jboss_by_red_hat:keycloak-ldap-federation:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jboss_by_red_hat:keycloak_ldap_federation:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak-ldap:keycloak-ldap-federation:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak-ldap:keycloak_ldap_federation:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak_ldap:keycloak-ldap-federation:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak_ldap:keycloak_ldap_federation:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.keycloak:keycloak-ldap-federation:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.keycloak:keycloak_ldap_federation:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak:keycloak-ldap-federation:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keycloak:keycloak_ldap_federation:4.8.1.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-ldap-federation@4.8.1.Final","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/modules/system/layers/keycloak/org/keycloak/keycloak-ldap-federation/main/keycloak-ldap-federation-4.8.1.Final.jar","pomArtifactID":"keycloak-ldap-federation","pomGroupID":"org.keycloak","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"5c51439c73ab7c5f208c60eb151c1b6c006938c6"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-xf46-8vvp-4hxx","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xf46-8vvp-4hxx","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Keycloak Missing authentication for critical function","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":1,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-20262","epss":0.00044,"percentile":0.13043,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.025960000000000004},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2021-20262","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20262","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1933639","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1933639"],"description":"A flaw was found in Keycloak 12.0.0 where re-authentication does not occur while updating the password.

is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In Netty before version 4.1.59.Final there is a vulnerability on Unix-like systems involving an insecure temp file. When netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method \"File.createTempFile\" on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions \"-rw-r--r--\". Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information. This is the case in netty's \"AbstractDiskHttpData\" is vulnerable. This has been fixed in version 4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own \"java.io.tmpdir\" when you start the JVM or use \"DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)\" to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":1.9,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.2,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-21290","epss":0.00016,"percentile":0.02338,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"netty-codec-http","version":"4.1.24.Final"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=4.0.0,<4.1.59.Final

temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.1,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cve-coordination@google.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-8908","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00491,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"guava","version":"25.0-jre"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<32.0.0-android

temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.1,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cve-coordination@google.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-8908","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00491,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"guava","version":"25.0-jre"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<32.0.0-android
