If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default configuration). OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this issue.

BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected

It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a \"purpose\" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named \"purpose\" values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected 1.1.1h-1.1.1j).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-3450","epss":0.00441,"percentile":0.62313,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["10.24.1","12.22.1","14.16.1","15.14.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.310905},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:14.15.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"14.15.4"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2021-3450","versionConstraint":">= 10.0.0, < 10.24.1,>= 12.0.0, < 12.22.1,>= 14.0.0, < 14.16.1,>= 15.0.0, < 15.14.0 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"14.16.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"1498e1978df404ff","name":"node","version":"14.15.4","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/node","accessPath":"/bin/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:14.15.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/node@14.15.4","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-22884","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22884","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf","https://hackerone.com/reports/1069487","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/E4FRS5ZVK4ZQ7XIJQNGIKUXG2DJFHLO7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F45Y7TXSU33MTKB6AGL2Q5V5ZOCNPKOG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HSYFUGKFUSZ27M5TEZ3FKILWTWFJTFAZ/","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/february-2021-security-releases/","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/march-2018-security-releases/#node-js-inspector-dns-rebinding-vulnerability-cve-2018-7160","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210416-0001/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210723-0001/","https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html","https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf","https://hackerone.com/reports/1069487","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/E4FRS5ZVK4ZQ7XIJQNGIKUXG2DJFHLO7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F45Y7TXSU33MTKB6AGL2Q5V5ZOCNPKOG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HSYFUGKFUSZ27M5TEZ3FKILWTWFJTFAZ/","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/february-2021-security-releases/","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/march-2018-security-releases/#node-js-inspector-dns-rebinding-vulnerability-cve-2018-7160","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210416-0001/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210723-0001/","https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"],"description":"Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks as the whitelist includes “localhost6”.
