Starting in version 1.11.4 and prior to versions 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3, it is possible to bypass authorization checks within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware.

This vulnerability emerges during the repair operation, where the \"msiexec.exe\" process, running under the NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM context, attempts to read the %USERPROFILE% environment variable from the current user's registry.\n\nThe issue arises when the path referenced by the %USERPROFILE% environment variable does not exist. In such cases, the \"msiexec.exe\" process attempts to create the specified path in an unsafe manner, potentially leading to the creation of arbitrary folders in arbitrary locations.\n\nThe severity of this vulnerability is heightened by the fact that the %USERPROFILE% environment variable in the Windows registry can be modified by standard (or \"non-privileged\") users. Consequently, unprivileged actors, including malicious entities or trojans, can manipulate the environment variable key to deceive the privileged \"msiexec.exe\" process. This manipulation can result in the creation of folders in unintended and potentially malicious locations.\n\nIt is important to note that this vulnerability is specific to Windows users who install Node.js using the .msi installer.

NPM package `micromatch` prior to 4.0.8 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persists. This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to greedy matching.

In affected versions OpenPGP Cleartext Signed Messages are cryptographically signed messages where the signed text is readable without special tools. These messages typically contain a \"Hash: ...\" header declaring the hash algorithm used to compute the signature digest. OpenPGP.js up to v5.9.0 ignored any data preceding the \"Hash: ...\" texts when verifying the signature. As a result, malicious parties could add arbitrary text to a third-party Cleartext Signed Message, to lead the victim to believe that the arbitrary text was signed. A user or application is vulnerable to said attack vector if it verifies the CleartextMessage by only checking the returned `verified` property, discarding the associated `data` information, and instead _visually trusting_ the contents of the original message. Since `verificationResult.data` would always contain the actual signed data, users and apps that check this information are not vulnerable. Similarly, given a CleartextMessage object, retrieving the data using `getText()` or the `text` field returns only the contents that are considered when verifying the signature. Finally, re-armoring a CleartextMessage object (using `armor()` will also result in a \"sanitised\" version, with the extraneous text being removed. This issue has been addressed in version 5.10.1 (current stable version) which will reject messages when calling `openpgp.readCleartextMessage()` and in version 4.10.11 (legacy version) which will will reject messages when calling `openpgp.cleartext.readArmored()`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should check the contents of `verificationResult.data` to see what data was actually signed, rather than visually trusting the contents of the armored message.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.3,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.3,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-41037","epss":0.00076,"percentile":0.23674,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"openpgp","version":"5.7.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=5.0.0,<5.10.1 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-ch3c-v47x-4pgp"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"5.10.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"6adadf71de23b76e","name":"openpgp","version":"5.7.0","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/node_modules/openpgp/package.json","accessPath":"/node_modules/openpgp/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["LGPL-3.0+"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openpgpjs:openpgp:5.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openpgp:openpgp:5.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/openpgp@5.7.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-wf5p-g6vw-rhxx","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wf5p-g6vw-rhxx","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Axios Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45857","epss":0.00055,"percentile":0.17263,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.6.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.031625},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-45857","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45857","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6006","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/","https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6006","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/"],"description":"An issue discovered in Axios 1.5.1 inadvertently reveals the confidential XSRF-TOKEN stored in cookies by including it in the HTTP header X-XSRF-TOKEN for every request made to any host allowing attackers to view sensitive information.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45857","epss":0.00055,"percentile":0.17263,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"axios","version":"1.3.4"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=1.0.0,<1.6.0 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-wf5p-g6vw-rhxx"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.6.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"977784830f155271","name":"axios","version":"1.3.4","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/node_modules/axios/package.json","accessPath":"/node_modules/axios/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:axios:axios:1.3.4:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/axios@1.3.4","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-rhx6-c78j-4q9w","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rhx6-c78j-4q9w","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"path-to-regexp contains a ReDoS","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-52798","epss":0.00041,"percentile":0.11911,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.1.12"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.03075},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-52798","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52798","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/commit/f01c26a013b1889f0c217c643964513acf17f6a4","https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/security/advisories/GHSA-rhx6-c78j-4q9w","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250124-0002/"],"description":"path-to-regexp turns path strings into a regular expressions.

Startinf in version 5.0.1 and prior to versions 5.11.3 and 6.1.1, a maliciously modified message can be passed to either `openpgp.verify` or `openpgp.decrypt`, causing these functions to return a valid signature verification result while returning data that was not actually signed. This flaw allows signature verifications of inline (non-detached) signed messages (using `openpgp.verify`) and signed-and-encrypted messages (using `openpgp.decrypt` with `verificationKeys`) to be spoofed, since both functions return extracted data that may not match the data that was originally signed. Detached signature verifications are not affected, as no signed data is returned in that case. In order to spoof a message, the attacker needs a single valid message signature (inline or detached) as well as the plaintext data that was legitimately signed, and can then construct an inline-signed message or signed-and-encrypted message with any data of the attacker's choice, which will appear as legitimately signed by affected versions of OpenPGP.js. In other words, any inline-signed message can be modified to return any other data (while still indicating that the signature was valid), and the same is true for signed+encrypted messages if the attacker can obtain a valid signature and encrypt a new message (of the attacker's choice) together with that signature. The issue has been patched in versions 5.11.3 and 6.1.1. Some workarounds are available. When verifying inline-signed messages, extract the message and signature(s) from the message returned by `openpgp.readMessage`, and verify the(/each) signature as a detached signature by passing the signature and a new message containing only the data (created using `openpgp.createMessage`) to `openpgp.verify`.  When decrypting and verifying signed+encrypted messages, decrypt and verify the message in two steps, by first calling `openpgp.decrypt` without `verificationKeys`, and then passing the returned signature(s) and a new message containing the decrypted data (created using `openpgp.createMessage`) to `openpgp.verify`.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":8.7},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-47934","epss":0.00024,"percentile":0.05081,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"openpgp","version":"5.7.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=5.0.1,<=5.11.2 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-8qff-qr5q-5pr8"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"5.11.3"}}],"artifact":{"id":"6adadf71de23b76e","name":"openpgp","version":"5.7.0","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/node_modules/openpgp/package.json","accessPath":"/node_modules/openpgp/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["LGPL-3.0+"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openpgpjs:openpgp:5.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openpgp:openpgp:5.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/openpgp@5.7.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-m6fv-jmcg-4jfg","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m6fv-jmcg-4jfg","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"send vulnerable to template injection that can lead to XSS","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-43799","epss":0.00042,"percentile":0.12207,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.19.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.016800000000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-43799","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43799","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/pillarjs/send/commit/ae4f2989491b392ae2ef3b0015a019770ae65d35","https://github.com/pillarjs/send/security/advisories/GHSA-m6fv-jmcg-4jfg"],"description":"Send is a library for streaming files from the file system as a http response.

When using versions of Babel prior to 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17 to compile regular expression named capturing groups, Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`). Generated code is vulnerable if all the following conditions are true: Using Babel to compile regular expression named capturing groups, using the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups, and the code using untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`. This problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17. It's likely that individual users do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`).

This issue only affects the Pages Router under certain misconfigurations, causing normal endpoints to serve `pageProps` data instead of standard HTML. This issue was patched in versions 15.1.6 and 14.2.24 by stripping the `x-now-route-matches` header from incoming requests. Applications hosted on Vercel's platform are not affected by this issue, as the platform does not cache responses based solely on `200 OK` status without explicit `cache-control` headers. Those who self-host Next.js deployments and are unable to upgrade immediately can mitigate this vulnerability by stripping the `x-now-route-matches` header from all incoming requests at the content development network and setting `cache-control: no-store` for all responses under risk.
