Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send.

The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45337","epss":0.36067,"percentile":0.9691,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.17.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.31.0 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v778-237x-gjrc"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.31.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"1cc8218fc9d54de3","name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.17.0","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/ifacetool-engine","accessPath":"/bin/ifacetool-engine","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:go:ssh:v0.17.0:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/crypto@v0.17.0","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.10","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:r8bRNjWL3GshPW3gkd+RpvzWrZAwPS49OmTGZ/uhM4k=","mainModule":"github.com/pedronis/ifacetool"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Unintended leak of Proxy-Authorization header in requests","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-32681","epss":0.04731,"percentile":0.88915,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.31.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":2.6257049999999995},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-32681","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32681","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/psf/requests/commit/74ea7cf7a6a27a4eeb2ae24e162bcc942a6706d5","https://github.com/psf/requests/releases/tag/v2.31.0","https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00018.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AW7HNFGYP44RT3DUDQXG2QT3OEV2PJ7Y/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KOYASTZDGQG2BWLSNBPL3TQRL2G7QYNZ/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-08","https://github.com/psf/requests/commit/74ea7cf7a6a27a4eeb2ae24e162bcc942a6706d5","https://github.com/psf/requests/releases/tag/v2.31.0","https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00018.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AW7HNFGYP44RT3DUDQXG2QT3OEV2PJ7Y/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KOYASTZDGQG2BWLSNBPL3TQRL2G7QYNZ/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-08"],"description":"Requests is a HTTP library. Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request.

Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1, with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped.

However since this\nfunction is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-0727","epss":0.00103,"percentile":0.29443,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"cryptography","version":"38.0.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<42.0.2 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-9v9h-cgj8-h64p"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"42.0.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"8a95fc803e6e1694","name":"cryptography","version":"38.0.1","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cryptography-38.0.1.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cryptography-38.0.1.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cryptography-38.0.1.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cryptography-38.0.1.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cryptography-38.0.1.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cryptography-38.0.1.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause OR Apache-2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:cryptography.io:cryptography:38.0.1:*:*:*:*:python:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cryptography.io:cryptography:38.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/cryptography@38.0.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-24536","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24536","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/482075","https://go.dev/cl/482076","https://go.dev/cl/482077","https://go.dev/issue/59153","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Xdv6JL9ENs8","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1705","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230526-0007/","https://go.dev/cl/482075","https://go.dev/cl/482076","https://go.dev/cl/482077","https://go.dev/issue/59153","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Xdv6JL9ENs8","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1705","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230526-0007/"],"description":"Multipart form parsing can consume large amounts of CPU and memory when processing form inputs containing very large numbers of parts. This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In addition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts.

It is possible there are larger keys in use in private PKIs, but we target the web PKI, so causing breakage here in the interests of increasing the default safety of users of crypto/tls seems reasonable.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-29409","epss":0.00082,"percentile":0.25252,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.12","1.20.7"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.042230000000000004},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.10"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-29409","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.12,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.7,= 1.21.0-rc1,= 1.21.0-rc2,= 1.21.0-rc3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.12"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a715e76c21251c25","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.10","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/ifacetool-engine","accessPath":"/bin/ifacetool-engine","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.18.10","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.10","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-34155","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34155","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/611238","https://go.dev/issue/69138","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/S9POB9NCTdk","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-3105","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240926-0005/"],"description":"Calling any of the Parse functions on Go source code which contains deeply nested literals can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.3,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-34155","epss":0.0009,"percentile":0.26978,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.22.7","1.23.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.04185},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.10"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-34155","versionConstraint":"< 1.22.7,>= 1.23.0-0, < 1.23.1 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.22.7"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a715e76c21251c25","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.10","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/ifacetool-engine","accessPath":"/bin/ifacetool-engine","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.18.10","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.10","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-45285","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45285","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/540257","https://go.dev/issue/63845","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/6ypN5EjibjM/m/KmLVYH_uAgAJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UIU6HOGV6RRIKWM57LOXQA75BGZSIH6G/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2383","https://go.dev/cl/540257","https://go.dev/issue/63845","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/6ypN5EjibjM/m/KmLVYH_uAgAJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UIU6HOGV6RRIKWM57LOXQA75BGZSIH6G/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2383"],"description":"Using go get to fetch a module with the \".git\" suffix may unexpectedly fallback to the insecure \"git://\" protocol if the module is unavailable via the secure \"https://\" and \"git+ssh://\" protocols, even if GOINSECURE is not set for said module.

Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41725","epss":0.00051,"percentile":0.15979,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.6"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.038250000000000006},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.10"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-41725","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.6,= 1.20.0,= 1.20.0-rc1,= 1.20.0-rc2,= 1.20.0-rc3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.6"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a715e76c21251c25","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.10","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/ifacetool-engine","accessPath":"/bin/ifacetool-engine","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.18.10","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.10","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-hcg3-q754-cr77","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hcg3-q754-cr77","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"golang.org/x/crypto Vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) via Slow or Incomplete Key Exchange","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-22869","epss":0.00051,"percentile":0.15903,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.35.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.038250000000000006},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-22869","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22869","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/652135","https://go.dev/issue/71931","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3487","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250411-0010/"],"description":"SSH servers which implement file transfer protocols are vulnerable to a denial of service attack from clients which complete the key exchange slowly, or not at all, causing pending content to be read into memory, but never transmitted.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-22869","epss":0.00051,"percentile":0.15903,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.17.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.35.0 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-hcg3-q754-cr77"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.35.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"1cc8218fc9d54de3","name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.17.0","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/ifacetool-engine","accessPath":"/bin/ifacetool-engine","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:go:ssh:v0.17.0:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/crypto@v0.17.0","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.10","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:r8bRNjWL3GshPW3gkd+RpvzWrZAwPS49OmTGZ/uhM4k=","mainModule":"github.com/pedronis/ifacetool"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-29400","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29400","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/491617","https://go.dev/issue/59722","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/MEb0UyuSMsU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1753","https://go.dev/cl/491617","https://go.dev/issue/59722","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/MEb0UyuSMsU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1753","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241213-0005/"],"description":"Templates containing actions in unquoted HTML attributes (e.g. \"attr={{.}}\") executed with empty input can result in output with unexpected results when parsed due to HTML normalization rules.

With fix, header parsing now correctly allocates only the memory required to hold parsed headers.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24534","epss":0.00045,"percentile":0.133,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.8","1.20.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.03375},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.10"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-24534","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.8,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a715e76c21251c25","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.10","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/ifacetool-engine","accessPath":"/bin/ifacetool-engine","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.18.10","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.10","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"urllib3's request body not stripped after redirect from 303 status changes request method to GET","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45803","epss":0.00062,"percentile":0.1968,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.26.18"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.02852},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-45803","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45803","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/4e98d57809dacab1cbe625fddeec1a290c478ea9","https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/security/advisories/GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4R2Y5XK3WALSR3FNAGN7JBYV2B343ZKB/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5F5CUBAN5XMEBVBZPHFITBLMJV5FIJJ5/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PPDPLM6UUMN55ESPQWJFLLIZY4ZKCNRX/","https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-get","https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/4e98d57809dacab1cbe625fddeec1a290c478ea9","https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/security/advisories/GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4R2Y5XK3WALSR3FNAGN7JBYV2B343ZKB/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5F5CUBAN5XMEBVBZPHFITBLMJV5FIJJ5/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PPDPLM6UUMN55ESPQWJFLLIZY4ZKCNRX/","https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-get"],"description":"urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 301, 302, or 303 after the request had its method changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs. Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45803","epss":0.00062,"percentile":0.1968,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"1.26.12"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=0,<1.26.18 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.26.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"d2aa1c3d93f9b64b","name":"urllib3","version":"1.26.12","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.12.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.12.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.12.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.12.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.12.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.12.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:urllib3:1.26.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/urllib3@1.26.12","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-39326","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39326","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/547335","https://go.dev/issue/64433","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/6ypN5EjibjM/m/KmLVYH_uAgAJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UIU6HOGV6RRIKWM57LOXQA75BGZSIH6G/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2382","https://go.dev/cl/547335","https://go.dev/issue/64433","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/6ypN5EjibjM/m/KmLVYH_uAgAJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UIU6HOGV6RRIKWM57LOXQA75BGZSIH6G/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2382"],"description":"A malicious HTTP sender can use chunk extensions to cause a receiver reading from a request or response body to read many more bytes from the network than are in the body.

For example, a chain of redirects from a.com/, to b.com/1, and finally to b.com/2 would incorrectly send the Authorization header to b.com/2.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45336","epss":0.00035,"percentile":0.08883,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.22.11","1.23.5","1.24.0-rc.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.019424999999999998},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.10"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-45336","versionConstraint":"< 1.22.11,>= 1.23.0-0, < 1.23.5,>= 1.24.0-0, < 1.24.0-rc.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.22.11"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a715e76c21251c25","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.10","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/ifacetool-engine","accessPath":"/bin/ifacetool-engine","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.18.10","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.10","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-22871","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22871","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/652998","https://go.dev/issue/71988","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Y2uBTVKjBQk","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3563","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/04/04/4"],"description":"The net/http package improperly accepts a bare LF as a line terminator in chunked data chunk-size lines.

When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not user the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigations.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37891","epss":0.00033,"percentile":0.08049,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"1.26.12"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.26.19 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.26.19"}}],"artifact":{"id":"d2aa1c3d93f9b64b","name":"urllib3","version":"1.26.12","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.12.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.12.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.12.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.12.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.12.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.12.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:urllib3:1.26.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/urllib3@1.26.12","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-24537","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24537","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/482078","https://go.dev/issue/59180","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Xdv6JL9ENs8","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1702","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://go.dev/cl/482078","https://go.dev/issue/59180","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Xdv6JL9ENs8","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1702","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241129-0004/"],"description":"Calling any of the Parse functions on Go source code which contains //line directives with very large line numbers can cause an infinite loop due to integer overflow.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24537","epss":0.0002,"percentile":0.03871,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.8","1.20.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.015000000000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.10"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-24537","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.8,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a715e76c21251c25","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.10","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/ifacetool-engine","accessPath":"/bin/ifacetool-engine","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.18.10","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.10","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-45341","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45341","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/643099","https://go.dev/issue/71156","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/CAWXhan3Jww/m/bk9LAa-lCgAJ","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/bG8cv1muIBM/m/G461hA6lCgAJ","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3373","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250221-0004/"],"description":"A certificate with a URI which has a IPv6 address with a zone ID may incorrectly satisfy a URI name constraint that applies to the certificate chain.
