X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but\nthe public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type\nof the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by\nthe OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an\nASN1_STRING.\n\nWhen CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the\nX509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass\narbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or\nenact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to\nprovide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a\nvalid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other\ninput must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which\nis uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect\napplications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs\nover a

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers.

Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send.

The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45337","epss":0.36067,"percentile":0.9691,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.0.0-20220829220503-c86fa9a7ed90"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.31.0 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v778-237x-gjrc"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.31.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"f412ee3d0d2d70b0","name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.0.0-20220829220503-c86fa9a7ed90","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/srv/snapassert/bin/snap-assertions-service","accessPath":"/srv/snapassert/bin/snap-assertions-service","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:go:ssh:v0.0.0-20220829220503-c86fa9a7ed90:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/crypto@v0.0.0-20220829220503-c86fa9a7ed90","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.1","architecture":"amd64","mainModule":"snap-assertions-service"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-cf56-g6w6-pqq2","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cf56-g6w6-pqq2","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Twisted vulnerable to HTML injection in HTTP redirect body","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-41810","epss":0.24186,"percentile":0.95799,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["24.7.0rc1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":13.423229999999997},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-41810","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41810","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/twisted/twisted/commit/046a164f89a0f08d3239ecebd750360f8914df33","https://github.com/twisted/twisted/security/advisories/GHSA-cf56-g6w6-pqq2","https://github.com/twisted/twisted/commit/046a164f89a0f08d3239ecebd750360f8914df33","https://github.com/twisted/twisted/security/advisories/GHSA-cf56-g6w6-pqq2"],"description":"Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications, supporting Python 3.6+.

is a HTTP library. Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

2.31.0.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-32681","epss":0.04731,"percentile":0.88915,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"requests","version":"2.25.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=2.3.0,<2.31.0

Version 78.1.1 fixes the issue.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":7.7},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-47273","epss":0.00435,"percentile":0.62062,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"setuptools","version":"70.0.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<78.1.1 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-5rjg-fvgr-3xxf"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"78.1.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"39e5f77d810c9a6e","name":"setuptools","version":"70.0.0","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/srv/review-tools/lib/python3.10/site-packages/setuptools-70.0.0.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/srv/review-tools/lib/python3.10/site-packages/setuptools-70.0.0.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/srv/review-tools/lib/python3.10/site-packages/setuptools-70.0.0.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/srv/review-tools/lib/python3.10/site-packages/setuptools-70.0.0.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/srv/review-tools/lib/python3.10/site-packages/setuptools-70.0.0.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/srv/review-tools/lib/python3.10/site-packages/setuptools-70.0.0.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:setuptools:70.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/setuptools@70.0.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-24538","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24538","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/482079","https://go.dev/issue/59234","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Xdv6JL9ENs8","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1703","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://go.dev/cl/482079","https://go.dev/issue/59234","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Xdv6JL9ENs8","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1703","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241115-0007/"],"description":"Templates do not properly consider backticks (`) as Javascript string delimiters, and do not escape them as expected.

is a Python implementation of RFC 7519. PyJWT supports multiple different JWT signing algorithms. With JWT, an attacker submitting the JWT token can choose the used signing algorithm. The PyJWT library requires that the application chooses what algorithms are supported. The application can specify `jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()` to get support for all algorithms, or specify a single algorithm. The issue is not that big as `algorithms=jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()` has to be used. Users should upgrade to v2.4.0 to receive a patch for this issue. As a workaround, always be explicit with the algorithms that are accepted and expected when decoding.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-29217","epss":0.00418,"percentile":0.61038,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"pyjwt","version":"2.3.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=1.5.0,<2.4.0 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-ffqj-6fqr-9h24"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.4.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"725e99181a86ded1","name":"pyjwt","version":"2.3.0","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/PyJWT-2.3.0.egg-info/PKG-INFO","accessPath":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/PyJWT-2.3.0.egg-info/PKG-INFO","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/PyJWT-2.3.0.egg-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/PyJWT-2.3.0.egg-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:jose_padilla_project:python-pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jose_padilla_project:python_pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jose_padillaproject:python-pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jose_padillaproject:python_pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:hello_project:python-pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:hello_project:python_pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jose_padilla_project:pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:helloproject:python-pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:helloproject:python_pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jose_padilla:python-pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jose_padilla:python_pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jose_padillaproject:pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-pyjwt:python-pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-pyjwt:python_pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_pyjwt:python-pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_pyjwt:python_pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:hello_project:pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python-pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python_pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:hello:python-pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:hello:python_pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:helloproject:pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jose_padilla:pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:pyjwt:python-pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:pyjwt:python_pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-pyjwt:pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_pyjwt:pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:hello:pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:pyjwt:pyjwt:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/pyjwt@2.3.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-29405","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29405","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/501224","https://go.dev/issue/60306","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/q5135a9d924/m/j0ZoAJOHAwAJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NZ2O6YCO2IZMZJELQGZYR2WAUNEDLYV6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XBS3IIK6ADV24C5ULQU55QLT2UE762ZX/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1842","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://go.dev/cl/501224","https://go.dev/issue/60306","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/q5135a9d924/m/j0ZoAJOHAwAJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NZ2O6YCO2IZMZJELQGZYR2WAUNEDLYV6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XBS3IIK6ADV24C5ULQU55QLT2UE762ZX/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1842","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241206-0003/"],"description":"The go command may execute arbitrary code at build time when using cgo.

It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code shouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk would usually be replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, an XML converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, for example, and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence.

This vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input that causes the `idna.encode()` function to process the input with considerable computational load, significantly increasing the processing time in a quadratic manner relative to the input size.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security@huntr.dev","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.2,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-3651","epss":0.00436,"percentile":0.62113,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"idna","version":"3.3"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<3.7 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-jjg7-2v4v-x38h"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.7"}}],"artifact":{"id":"30be7e210695bf55","name":"idna","version":"3.3","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/idna-3.3.egg-info/PKG-INFO","accessPath":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/idna-3.3.egg-info/PKG-INFO","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/idna-3.3.egg-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/idna-3.3.egg-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:kim_davies_project:python-idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:kim_davies_project:python_idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:kim_daviesproject:python-idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:kim_daviesproject:python_idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:kim_davies_project:idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:kim_project:python-idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:kim_project:python_idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-idna:python-idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-idna:python_idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_idna:python-idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_idna:python_idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:kim_davies:python-idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:kim_davies:python_idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:kim_daviesproject:idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:kimproject:python-idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:kimproject:python_idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python-idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python_idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:idna:python-idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:idna:python_idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:kim_project:idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-idna:idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_idna:idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:kim:python-idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:kim:python_idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:kim_davies:idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:kimproject:idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:idna:idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:kim:idna:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/idna@3.3","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-jjg7-2v4v-x38h","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jjg7-2v4v-x38h","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) vulnerable to denial of service from specially crafted inputs to idna.encode","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.2,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-3651","epss":0.00436,"percentile":0.62113,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.7"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.24416000000000004},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-3651","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3651","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/kjd/idna/commit/1d365e17e10d72d0b7876316fc7b9ca0eebdd38d","https://huntr.com/bounties/93d78d07-d791-4b39-a845-cbfabc44aadb","https://github.com/kjd/idna/commit/1d365e17e10d72d0b7876316fc7b9ca0eebdd38d","https://huntr.com/bounties/93d78d07-d791-4b39-a845-cbfabc44aadb"],"description":"A vulnerability was identified in the kjd/idna library, specifically within the `idna.encode()` function, affecting version 3.6.

is an event-based framework for internet applications, supporting Python 3.6+. Prior to version 22.4.0rc1, the Twisted Web HTTP 1.1 server, located in the `twisted.web.http` module, parsed several HTTP request constructs more leniently than permitted by RFC 7230. This non-conformant parsing can lead to desync if requests pass through multiple HTTP parsers, potentially resulting in HTTP request smuggling. Users who may be affected use Twisted Web's HTTP 1.1 server and/or proxy and also pass requests through a different HTTP server and/or proxy. The Twisted Web client is not affected. The HTTP 2.0 server uses a different parser, so it is not affected. The issue has been addressed in Twisted 22.4.0rc1.

is the instrumentation library for Go applications in Prometheus, and the promhttp package in client_golang provides tooling around HTTP servers and clients. In client_golang prior to version 1.11.1, HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an instrumented software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except `RequestsInFlight`; not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware; pass metric with `method` label name to our middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown `method`. client_golang version 1.11.1 contains a patch for this issue. Several workarounds are available, including removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp handlers; adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request method given by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy or web application firewall, configured to only allow a limited set of methods.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-21698","epss":0.00227,"percentile":0.45732,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/prometheus/client_golang","version":"v1.1.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.11.1 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-cg3q-j54f-5p7p"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.11.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"584a9823188323b0","name":"github.com/prometheus/client_golang","version":"v1.1.0","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/srv/snapstorage/bin/snapstorage","accessPath":"/srv/snapstorage/bin/snapstorage","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:prometheus:client-golang:v1.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:prometheus:client_golang:v1.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/prometheus/client_golang@v1.1.0","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.13.8","architecture":"x86_64","mainModule":"snapstorage"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-3pgj-pg6c-r5p7","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3pgj-pg6c-r5p7","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"OAuthLib vulnerable to DoS when attacker provides malicious IPV6 URI","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.7,"exploitabilityScore":2.1,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-36087","epss":0.00315,"percentile":0.5416,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.2.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.168525},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-36087","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36087","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/oauthlib/oauthlib/blob/2b8a44855a51ad5a5b0c348a08c2564a2e197ea2/oauthlib/uri_validate.py","https://github.com/oauthlib/oauthlib/blob/d4bafd9f1d0eba3766e933b1ac598cbbf37b8914/oauthlib/oauth2/rfc6749/grant_types/base.py#L232","https://github.com/oauthlib/oauthlib/commit/2e40b412c844ecc4673c3fa3f72181f228bdbacd","https://github.com/oauthlib/oauthlib/releases/tag/v3.2.1","https://github.com/oauthlib/oauthlib/security/advisories/GHSA-3pgj-pg6c-r5p7","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LXOPIA6M57CFQPUT6HHSNXCTV6QA3UDI/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NBCQJR3ZF7FVNTJYRVPVSQEQRAYZIUHU/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QRYLYHE5HWF6R2CRLJFUK4PILR47WXOE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/X2CQZM5CKOUM4GW2GTAPQEQFPITQ6F7S/","https://github.com/oauthlib/oauthlib/blob/2b8a44855a51ad5a5b0c348a08c2564a2e197ea2/oauthlib/uri_validate.py","https://github.com/oauthlib/oauthlib/blob/d4bafd9f1d0eba3766e933b1ac598cbbf37b8914/oauthlib/oauth2/rfc6749/grant_types/base.py#L232","https://github.com/oauthlib/oauthlib/commit/2e40b412c844ecc4673c3fa3f72181f228bdbacd","https://github.com/oauthlib/oauthlib/releases/tag/v3.2.1","https://github.com/oauthlib/oauthlib/security/advisories/GHSA-3pgj-pg6c-r5p7","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LXOPIA6M57CFQPUT6HHSNXCTV6QA3UDI/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NBCQJR3ZF7FVNTJYRVPVSQEQRAYZIUHU/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QRYLYHE5HWF6R2CRLJFUK4PILR47WXOE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/X2CQZM5CKOUM4GW2GTAPQEQFPITQ6F7S/"],"description":"OAuthLib is an implementation of the OAuth request-signing logic for Python 3.6+.

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.9.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.17.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"52046d7320a12326","name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.9.0","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/srv/snapassert/bin/snap-assertions-service","accessPath":"/srv/snapassert/bin/snap-assertions-service","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:networking:v0.9.0:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/net@v0.9.0","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.1","architecture":"amd64","mainModule":"snap-assertions-service"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-q2x7-8rv6-6q7h","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q2x7-8rv6-6q7h","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Jinja has a sandbox breakout through indirect reference to format method","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-56326","epss":0.00103,"percentile":0.29452,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.1.5"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.06592},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-56326","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56326","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/pallets/jinja/commit/48b0687e05a5466a91cd5812d604fa37ad0943b4","https://github.com/pallets/jinja/releases/tag/3.1.5","https://github.com/pallets/jinja/security/advisories/GHSA-q2x7-8rv6-6q7h"],"description":"Jinja is an extensible templating engine.

This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":5.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-56201","epss":0.00064,"percentile":0.2041,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"jinja2","version":"3.1.4"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=3.0.0,<=3.1.4 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-gmj6-6f8f-6699"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.1.5"}}],"artifact":{"id":"96062cdc2760a46f","name":"jinja2","version":"3.1.4","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/srv/snapident/lib/python3.10/site-packages/jinja2-3.1.4.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/srv/snapident/lib/python3.10/site-packages/jinja2-3.1.4.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/srv/snapident/lib/python3.10/site-packages/jinja2-3.1.4.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/srv/snapident/lib/python3.10/site-packages/jinja2-3.1.4.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python-jinja2:python-jinja2:3.1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-jinja2:python_jinja2:3.1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_jinja2:python-jinja2:3.1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_jinja2:python_jinja2:3.1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jinja2:python-jinja2:3.1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jinja2:python_jinja2:3.1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-jinja2:jinja2:3.1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python-jinja2:3.1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python_jinja2:3.1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_jinja2:jinja2:3.1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jinja2:jinja2:3.1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:jinja2:3.1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/jinja2@3.1.4","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-2wrh-6pvc-2jm9","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2wrh-6pvc-2jm9","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Improper rendering of text nodes in golang.org/x/net/html","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-3978","epss":0.00078,"percentile":0.24378,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.13.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.043289999999999995},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-3978","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3978","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/514896","https://go.dev/issue/61615","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1988","https://go.dev/cl/514896","https://go.dev/issue/61615","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1988"],"description":"Text nodes not in the HTML namespace are incorrectly literally rendered, causing text which should be escaped to not be.

Since exploitation requires the combination of buggy h11 with a buggy (reverse) proxy, fixing either component is sufficient to mitigate this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-43859","epss":0.00044,"percentile":0.13105,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"h11","version":"0.13.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.16.0 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-vqfr-h8mv-ghfj"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.16.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"c41eee114594d88a","name":"h11","version":"0.13.0","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/srv/storeadmingw/lib/python3.10/site-packages/h11-0.13.0.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/srv/storeadmingw/lib/python3.10/site-packages/h11-0.13.0.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/srv/storeadmingw/lib/python3.10/site-packages/h11-0.13.0.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/srv/storeadmingw/lib/python3.10/site-packages/h11-0.13.0.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/srv/storeadmingw/lib/python3.10/site-packages/h11-0.13.0.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/srv/storeadmingw/lib/python3.10/site-packages/h11-0.13.0.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nathaniel_j__smith_project:python-h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nathaniel_j__smith_project:python_h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nathaniel_j__smithproject:python-h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nathaniel_j__smithproject:python_h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nathaniel_j__smith_project:h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nathaniel_j__smith:python-h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nathaniel_j__smith:python_h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nathaniel_j__smithproject:h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nathaniel_j__smith:h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:njs_project:python-h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:njs_project:python_h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:njsproject:python-h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:njsproject:python_h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-h11:python-h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-h11:python_h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_h11:python-h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_h11:python_h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python-h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python_h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:njs_project:h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:h11:python-h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:h11:python_h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:njs:python-h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:njs:python_h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:njsproject:h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-h11:h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_h11:h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:h11:h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:njs:h11:0.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/h11@0.13.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-79v4-65xg-pq4g","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-79v4-65xg-pq4g","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"Vulnerable OpenSSL included in cryptography wheels","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-12797","epss":0.0013,"percentile":0.33811,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["44.0.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.039},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-12797","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-12797","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/738d4f9fdeaad57660dcba50a619fafced3fd5e9","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/798779d43494549b611233f92652f0da5328fbe7","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/87ebd203feffcf92ad5889df92f90bb0ee10a699","https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20250211.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/02/11/3","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/02/11/4","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250214-0001/"],"description":"Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a\nserver may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated, because\nhandshakes don't abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode\nis set.\n\nImpact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be\nvulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not\ndetected by clients.\n\nRPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers.

Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption.

Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own.

is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 301, 302, or 303 after the request had its method changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs. Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45803","epss":0.00062,"percentile":0.1968,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"1.26.5"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=0,<1.26.18 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.26.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"043d634961733646","name":"urllib3","version":"1.26.5","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/urllib3-1.26.5.egg-info/PKG-INFO","accessPath":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/urllib3-1.26.5.egg-info/PKG-INFO","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/urllib3-1.26.5.egg-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/urllib3-1.26.5.egg-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:urllib3:1.26.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/urllib3@1.26.5","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-39326","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39326","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/547335","https://go.dev/issue/64433","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/6ypN5EjibjM/m/KmLVYH_uAgAJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UIU6HOGV6RRIKWM57LOXQA75BGZSIH6G/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2382","https://go.dev/cl/547335","https://go.dev/issue/64433","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/6ypN5EjibjM/m/KmLVYH_uAgAJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UIU6HOGV6RRIKWM57LOXQA75BGZSIH6G/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2382"],"description":"A malicious HTTP sender can use chunk extensions to cause a receiver reading from a request or response body to read many more bytes from the network than are in the body.

Prior to 3.1.6, an oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment interacts with the |attr filter allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox.

Normal use of regular expressions is unaffected.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41715","epss":0.00016,"percentile":0.02244,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.18.7","1.19.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.012000000000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.1:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-41715","versionConstraint":"< 1.18.7,>= 1.19.0, < 1.19.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.18.7"}}],"artifact":{"id":"747846749c9123ec","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.1","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/srv/snapassert/bin/snap-assertions-service","accessPath":"/srv/snapassert/bin/snap-assertions-service","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.1:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.18.1","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.1","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-41724","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41724","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/468125","https://go.dev/issue/58001","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1570","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://go.dev/cl/468125","https://go.dev/issue/58001","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1570","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09"],"description":"Large handshake records may cause panics in crypto/tls.
