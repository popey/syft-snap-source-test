buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.

An attacker can craft a malicious email address in a certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.' character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service). In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server.

vulnerability has been identified in the Node.js (.msi version) installation process, specifically affecting Windows users who install Node.js using the .msi installer. This vulnerability emerges during the repair operation, where the \"msiexec.exe\" process, running under the NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM context, attempts to read the %USERPROFILE% environment variable from the current user's registry.\n\nThe issue arises when the path referenced by the %USERPROFILE% environment variable does not exist. In such cases, the \"msiexec.exe\" process attempts to create the specified path in an unsafe manner, potentially leading to the creation of arbitrary folders in arbitrary locations.\n\nThe severity of this vulnerability is heightened by the fact that the %USERPROFILE% environment variable in the Windows registry can be modified by standard (or \"non-privileged\") users. Consequently, unprivileged actors, including malicious entities or trojans, can manipulate the environment variable key to deceive the privileged \"msiexec.exe\" process. This manipulation can result in the creation of folders in unintended and potentially malicious locations.\n\nIt is important to note that this vulnerability is specific to Windows users who install Node.js using the .msi installer. Users who opt for other installation methods are not affected by this particular issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-30585","epss":0.0108,"percentile":0.76823,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["16.20.1","18.16.1","20.3.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.8099999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:18.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"18.0.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-30585","versionConstraint":">= 16.0.0, < 16.20.1,>= 18.0.0, < 18.16.1,>= 20.0.0, < 20.3.1 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"18.16.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"91ead07b8f10412f","name":"node","version":"18.0.0","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/node","accessPath":"/bin/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:18.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/node@18.0.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-35255","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35255","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-332410.pdf","https://hackerone.com/reports/1690000","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230113-0002/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5326","https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-332410.pdf","https://hackerone.com/reports/1690000","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230113-0002/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5326"],"description":"A weak randomness in WebCrypto keygen vulnerability exists in Node.js 18 due to a change with EntropySource() in SecretKeyGenTraits::DoKeyGen() in src/crypto/crypto_keygen.cc.

is a Tar for Node.js. node-tar prior to version 6.2.1 has no limit on the number of sub-folders created in the folder creation process. An attacker who generates a large number of sub-folders can consume memory on the system running node-tar and even crash the Node.js client within few seconds of running it using a path with too many sub-folders inside. Version 6.2.1 fixes this issue by preventing extraction in excessively deep sub-folders.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-28863","epss":0.00205,"percentile":0.4327,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"6.1.11"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<6.2.1 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-f5x3-32g6-xq36"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.2.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"c3818addb9723047","name":"tar","version":"6.1.11","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/tar/package.json","accessPath":"/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:6.1.11:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@6.1.11","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-32222","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32222","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://hackerone.com/reports/1695596","https://hackerone.com/reports/1695596"],"description":"A cryptographic vulnerability exists on Node.js on linux in versions of 18.x prior to 18.40.0 which allowed a default path for openssl.cnf that might be accessible under some circumstances to a non-admin user instead of /etc/ssl as was the case in versions prior to the upgrade to OpenSSL 3.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-32222","epss":0.00214,"percentile":0.44308,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["18.5.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.11021},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:18.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"18.0.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-32222","versionConstraint":">= 18.0.0, < 18.5.0 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"18.5.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"91ead07b8f10412f","name":"node","version":"18.0.0","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/node","accessPath":"/bin/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:18.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/node@18.0.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-27982","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27982","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://hackerone.com/reports/2237099","https://hackerone.com/reports/2237099","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250418-0001/"],"description":"The team has identified a critical vulnerability in the http server of the most recent version of Node, where malformed headers can lead to HTTP request smuggling.
