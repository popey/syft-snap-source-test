This vulnerability emerges during the repair operation, where the \"msiexec.exe\" process, running under the NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM context, attempts to read the %USERPROFILE% environment variable from the current user's registry.\n\nThe issue arises when the path referenced by the %USERPROFILE% environment variable does not exist. In such cases, the \"msiexec.exe\" process attempts to create the specified path in an unsafe manner, potentially leading to the creation of arbitrary folders in arbitrary locations.\n\nThe severity of this vulnerability is heightened by the fact that the %USERPROFILE% environment variable in the Windows registry can be modified by standard (or \"non-privileged\") users. Consequently, unprivileged actors, including malicious entities or trojans, can manipulate the environment variable key to deceive the privileged \"msiexec.exe\" process. This manipulation can result in the creation of folders in unintended and potentially malicious locations.\n\nIt is important to note that this vulnerability is specific to Windows users who install Node.js using the .msi installer. Users who opt for other installation methods are not affected by this particular issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-30585","epss":0.0108,"percentile":0.76823,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["16.20.1","18.16.1","20.3.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.8099999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:18.14.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"node","version":"18.14.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-30585","versionConstraint":">= 16.0.0, < 16.20.1,>= 18.0.0, < 18.16.1,>= 20.0.0, < 20.3.1 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"18.16.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"bc27b9b91679b5ec","name":"node","version":"18.14.2","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/bin/node","accessPath":"/bin/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/src/node-v18.14.2-linux-x64/bin/node","accessPath":"/src/node-v18.14.2-linux-x64/bin/node","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:18.14.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/node@18.14.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-30589","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30589","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://hackerone.com/reports/2001873","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HMEELCREWMRT6NS7HWXLA6XFLLMO36HE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IV326O2X4BE3SINX5FJHMAKVHUAA4ZYF/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UEJWL67XR67JAGEL2ZK22NA3BRKNMZNY/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VCVG4TQRGTK4LKAZKVEQAUEJM7DUACYE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VEEQIN5242K5NBE2CZ4DYTNA5B4YTYE5/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VKFMKD4MJZIKFQJAAJ4VZ2FHIJ764A76/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230803-0009/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/","https://hackerone.com/reports/2001873","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HMEELCREWMRT6NS7HWXLA6XFLLMO36HE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IV326O2X4BE3SINX5FJHMAKVHUAA4ZYF/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UEJWL67XR67JAGEL2ZK22NA3BRKNMZNY/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VCVG4TQRGTK4LKAZKVEQAUEJM7DUACYE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VEEQIN5242K5NBE2CZ4DYTNA5B4YTYE5/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VKFMKD4MJZIKFQJAAJ4VZ2FHIJ764A76/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230803-0009/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/"],"description":"The llhttp parser in the http module in Node v20.2.0 does not strictly use the CRLF sequence to delimit HTTP requests.

By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persists.

is a compiler for writingJavaScript. In `@babel/traverse` prior to versions 7.23.2 and 8.0.0-alpha.4 and all versions of `babel-traverse`, using Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation, when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods. Known affected plugins are `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`; `@babel/preset-env` when using its `useBuiltIns` option; and any \"polyfill provider\" plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`, such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`. No other plugins under the `@babel/` namespace are impacted, but third-party plugins might be. Users that only compile trusted code are not impacted. The vulnerability has been fixed in `@babel/traverse@7.23.2` and `@babel/traverse@8.0.0-alpha.4`. Those who cannot upgrade `@babel/traverse` and are using one of the affected packages mentioned above should upgrade them to their latest version to avoid triggering the vulnerable code path in affected `@babel/traverse` versions: `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` v7.23.2, `@babel/preset-env` v7.23.2, `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` v0.4.3, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2` v0.4.6, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3` v0.8.5, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims` v0.10.0, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator` v0.5.3.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.1,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.3,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45133","epss":0.00067,"percentile":0.21274,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"@babel/traverse","version":"7.20.12"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<7.23.2 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-67hx-6x53-jw92"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"7.23.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"7f188de519707a84","name":"@babel/traverse","version":"7.20.12","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/app/node_modules/@babel/traverse/package.json","accessPath":"/app/node_modules/@babel/traverse/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:@babel/traverse:@babel/traverse:7.20.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:babel:@babel/traverse:7.20.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/%40babel/traverse@7.20.12","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-39333","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39333","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/october-2023-security-releases","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240808-0004/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241004-0006/"],"description":"Maliciously crafted export names in an imported WebAssembly module can inject JavaScript code.
