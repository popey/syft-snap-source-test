When using aiohttp as a web server and configuring static routes, it is necessary to specify the root path for static files. Additionally, the option 'follow_symlinks' can be used to determine whether to follow symbolic links outside the static root directory. When 'follow_symlinks' is set to True, there is no validation to check if reading a file is within the root directory. This can lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities, resulting in unauthorized access to arbitrary files on the system, even when symlinks are not present.  Disabling follow_symlinks and using a reverse proxy are encouraged mitigations.

extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC).

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45288","epss":0.64852,"percentile":0.98352,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.2.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.23.0 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4v7x-pqxf-cx7m"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.23.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"21517c7a4d78d0f5","name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.2.0","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/jujuc","accessPath":"/bin/jujuc","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:networking:v0.2.0:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/net@v0.2.0","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.10","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:sZfSu1wtKLGlWI4ZZayP0ck9Y73K1ynO6gqzTdBVdPU=","mainModule":"github.com/juju/juju"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-v778-237x-gjrc","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v778-237x-gjrc","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Critical","urls":[],"description":"Misuse of ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback may cause authorization bypass in golang.org/x/crypto","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45337","epss":0.36067,"percentile":0.9691,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.31.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":32.640635},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-45337","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45337","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://github.com/golang/crypto/commit/b4f1988a35dee11ec3e05d6bf3e90b695fbd8909","https://go.dev/cl/635315","https://go.dev/issue/70779","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/-nPEi39gI4Q/m/cGVPJCqdAQAJ","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-3321","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/12/11/2","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250131-0007/"],"description":"Applications and libraries which misuse connection.serverAuthenticate (via callback field ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback) may be susceptible to an authorization bypass.

Vulnerable code is used by aiohttp for its HTTP request parser when available which is the default case when installing from a wheel. This vulnerability only affects users of aiohttp as an HTTP server (ie `aiohttp.Application`), you are not affected by this vulnerability if you are using aiohttp as an HTTP client library (ie `aiohttp.ClientSession`). Sending a crafted HTTP request will cause the server to misinterpret one of the HTTP header values leading to HTTP request smuggling. This issue has been addressed in version 3.8.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade can reinstall aiohttp using `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1` as an environment variable to disable the llhttp HTTP request parser implementation. The pure Python implementation isn't vulnerable.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-37276","epss":0.05842,"percentile":0.9011,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"aiohttp","version":"3.8.4"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<=3.8.4 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-45c4-8wx5-qw6w"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.8.5"}}],"artifact":{"id":"2aaaffedf3d6fe93","name":"aiohttp","version":"3.8.4","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/aiohttp-3.8.4.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/aiohttp-3.8.4.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/aiohttp-3.8.4.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/aiohttp-3.8.4.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/aiohttp-3.8.4.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/aiohttp-3.8.4.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["Apache 2"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python-aiohttp:python-aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-aiohttp:python_aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_aiohttp:python-aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_aiohttp:python_aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:aiohttp:python-aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:aiohttp:python_aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-aiohttp:aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_aiohttp:aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python-aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python_aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:aiohttp:aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/aiohttp@3.8.4","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Unintended leak of Proxy-Authorization header in requests","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-32681","epss":0.04731,"percentile":0.88915,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.31.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":2.6257049999999995},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-32681","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32681","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/psf/requests/commit/74ea7cf7a6a27a4eeb2ae24e162bcc942a6706d5","https://github.com/psf/requests/releases/tag/v2.31.0","https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00018.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AW7HNFGYP44RT3DUDQXG2QT3OEV2PJ7Y/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KOYASTZDGQG2BWLSNBPL3TQRL2G7QYNZ/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-08","https://github.com/psf/requests/commit/74ea7cf7a6a27a4eeb2ae24e162bcc942a6706d5","https://github.com/psf/requests/releases/tag/v2.31.0","https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00018.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AW7HNFGYP44RT3DUDQXG2QT3OEV2PJ7Y/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KOYASTZDGQG2BWLSNBPL3TQRL2G7QYNZ/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-08"],"description":"Requests is a HTTP library. Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12.

is the instrumentation library for Go applications in Prometheus, and the promhttp package in client_golang provides tooling around HTTP servers and clients. In client_golang prior to version 1.11.1, HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an instrumented software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except `RequestsInFlight`; not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware; pass metric with `method` label name to our middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown `method`. client_golang version 1.11.1 contains a patch for this issue. Several workarounds are available, including removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp handlers; adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request method given by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy or web application firewall, configured to only allow a limited set of methods.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-21698","epss":0.00227,"percentile":0.45732,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/prometheus/client_golang","version":"v1.7.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.11.1

In client_golang prior to version 1.11.1, HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an instrumented software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except `RequestsInFlight`; not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware; pass metric with `method` label name to our middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown `method`. client_golang version 1.11.1 contains a patch for this issue. Several workarounds are available, including removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp handlers; adding custom middleware before

is the instrumentation library for Go applications in Prometheus, and the promhttp package in client_golang provides tooling around HTTP servers and clients. In client_golang prior to version 1.11.1, HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an instrumented software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except `RequestsInFlight`; not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware; pass metric with `method` label name to our middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown `method`. client_golang version 1.11.1 contains a patch for this issue. Several workarounds are available, including removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp handlers; adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request method given by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy or web application firewall, configured to only allow a limited set of methods.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-21698","epss":0.00227,"percentile":0.45732,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/prometheus/client_golang","version":"v1.7.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.11.1

Security-sensitive parts of the Python HTTP parser retained minor differences in allowable character sets, that must trigger error handling to robustly match frame boundaries of proxies in order to protect against injection of additional requests. Additionally, validation could trigger exceptions that were not handled consistently with processing of other malformed input.  Being more lenient than internet standards require could, depending on deployment environment, assist in request smuggling.

Prior to version 3.10.2, static routes which contain files with compressed variants (`.gz` or `.br` extension) are vulnerable to path traversal outside the root directory if those variants are symbolic links. The server protects static routes from path traversal outside the root directory when `follow_symlinks=False` (default).  It does this by resolving the requested URL to an absolute path and then checking that path relative to the root. However, these checks are not performed when looking for compressed variants in the `FileResponse` class, and symbolic links are then automatically followed when performing the `Path.stat()` and `Path.open()` to send the file.

Other users can disable `show_index` if unable to upgrade.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-27306","epss":0.00132,"percentile":0.34199,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"aiohttp","version":"3.8.4"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<3.9.4 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-7gpw-8wmc-pm8g"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.9.4"}}],"artifact":{"id":"2aaaffedf3d6fe93","name":"aiohttp","version":"3.8.4","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/aiohttp-3.8.4.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/aiohttp-3.8.4.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/aiohttp-3.8.4.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/aiohttp-3.8.4.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/aiohttp-3.8.4.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/aiohttp-3.8.4.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["Apache 2"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python-aiohttp:python-aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-aiohttp:python_aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_aiohttp:python-aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_aiohttp:python_aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:aiohttp:python-aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:aiohttp:python_aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-aiohttp:aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_aiohttp:aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python-aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python_aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:aiohttp:aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:aiohttp:3.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/aiohttp@3.8.4","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-mg3v-6m49-jhp3","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mg3v-6m49-jhp3","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"WebOb's location header normalization during redirect leads to open redirect","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-42353","epss":0.00127,"percentile":0.33513,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.8.8"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.07048499999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-42353","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42353","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/Pylons/webob/commit/f689bcf4f0a1f64f1735b1d5069aef5be6974b5b","https://github.com/Pylons/webob/security/advisories/GHSA-mg3v-6m49-jhp3"],"description":"WebOb provides objects for HTTP requests and responses.

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection.

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.2.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.2.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.2.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.00089,"percentile":0.26634,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.2.0"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<0.17.0 (go)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.17.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"21517c7a4d78d0f5","name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.2.0","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/jujuc","accessPath":"/bin/jujuc","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:networking:v0.2.0:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/net@v0.2.0","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.10","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:sZfSu1wtKLGlWI4ZZayP0ck9Y73K1ynO6gqzTdBVdPU=","mainModule":"github.com/juju/juju"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-q2x7-8rv6-6q7h","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q2x7-8rv6-6q7h","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Jinja has a sandbox breakout through indirect reference to format method","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-56326","epss":0.00103,"percentile":0.29452,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.1.5"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.06592},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-56326","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56326","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/pallets/jinja/commit/48b0687e05a5466a91cd5812d604fa37ad0943b4","https://github.com/pallets/jinja/releases/tag/3.1.5","https://github.com/pallets/jinja/security/advisories/GHSA-q2x7-8rv6-6q7h"],"description":"Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.5, An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to store a reference to a malicious string's format method, then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja, but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox.

The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but\nOpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12\nfiles from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will\nbe vulnerable to this issue.\n\nOpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),\nPKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()\nand PKCS12_newpass().\n\nWe have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this\nfunction is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-0727","epss":0.00103,"percentile":0.29443,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"cryptography","version":"3.3.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<42.0.2 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-9v9h-cgj8-h64p"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"42.0.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"79b0c148bf703622","name":"cryptography","version":"3.3.2","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/cryptography-3.3.2.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/cryptography-3.3.2.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/cryptography-3.3.2.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/cryptography-3.3.2.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/cryptography-3.3.2.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/cryptography-3.3.2.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["BSD or Apache License, Version 2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:cryptography.io:cryptography:3.3.2:*:*:*:*:python:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cryptography.io:cryptography:3.3.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/cryptography@3.3.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-2ppf-2m6f-6v6f","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2ppf-2m6f-6v6f","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"OpenStack improperly deletes access rules","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.1,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-6110","epss":0.00103,"percentile":0.29379,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.3.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.05407500000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-6110","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-6110","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2737","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2769","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6110","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2212960","https://code.engineering.redhat.com/gerrit/gitweb?p=python-openstackclient.git;a=commit;h=7a7c364bdd7b2cd2b56e73724110710a68d58abf","https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/python-openstackclient/+/888697"],"description":"A flaw was found in OpenStack.

It may also be possible to bypass attribute validation checks if they are blacklist-based.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-22195","epss":0.00102,"percentile":0.29275,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"jinja2","version":"3.1.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<3.1.3 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-h5c8-rqwp-cp95"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.1.3"}}],"artifact":{"id":"977308c412e54ffd","name":"jinja2","version":"3.1.2","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/Jinja2-3.1.2.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/Jinja2-3.1.2.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/Jinja2-3.1.2.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/Jinja2-3.1.2.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/Jinja2-3.1.2.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/Jinja2-3.1.2.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher_project:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher_project:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacherproject:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacherproject:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher_project:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin-ronacher:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin-ronacher:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacherproject:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-jinja2:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-jinja2:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_jinja2:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_jinja2:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin-ronacher:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jinja2:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jinja2:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-jinja2:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_jinja2:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jinja2:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/jinja2@3.1.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-hqxw-f8mx-cpmw","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hqxw-f8mx-cpmw","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"distribution catalog API endpoint can lead to OOM via malicious user input","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-2253","epss":0.00068,"percentile":0.21639,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.8.2-beta.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.051000000000000004},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-2253","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-2253","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2189886","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00035.html","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2189886","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00035.html"],"description":"A flaw was found in the `/v2/_catalog` endpoint in distribution/distribution, which accepts a parameter to control the maximum number of records returned (query string: `n`).

is an extensible templating engine. The `xmlattr` filter in affected versions of Jinja accepts keys containing non-attribute characters. XML/HTML attributes cannot contain spaces, `/`, `>`, or `=`, as each would then be interpreted as starting a separate attribute. If an application accepts keys (as opposed to only values) as user input, and renders these in pages that other users see as well, an attacker could use this to inject other attributes and perform XSS. The fix for CVE-2024-22195 only addressed spaces but not other characters. Accepting keys as user input is now explicitly considered an unintended use case of the `xmlattr` filter, and code that does so without otherwise validating the input should be flagged as insecure, regardless of Jinja version. Accepting _values_ as user input continues to be safe.

In versions on the 3.x branch prior to 3.1.5, a bug in the Jinja compiler allows an attacker that controls both the content and filename of a template to execute arbitrary Python code, regardless of if Jinja's sandbox is used. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control both the filename and the contents of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates where the template author can also choose the template filename. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":5.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-56201","epss":0.00064,"percentile":0.2041,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"jinja2","version":"3.1.2"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=3.0.0,<=3.1.4 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-gmj6-6f8f-6699"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.1.5"}}],"artifact":{"id":"977308c412e54ffd","name":"jinja2","version":"3.1.2","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/Jinja2-3.1.2.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/Jinja2-3.1.2.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/Jinja2-3.1.2.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/Jinja2-3.1.2.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/Jinja2-3.1.2.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/Jinja2-3.1.2.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher_project:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher_project:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacherproject:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacherproject:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher_project:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin-ronacher:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin-ronacher:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacherproject:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-jinja2:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-jinja2:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_jinja2:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_jinja2:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin-ronacher:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:armin_ronacher:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jinja2:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jinja2:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-jinja2:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python-jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python_jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_jinja2:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jinja2:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:jinja2:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/jinja2@3.1.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-2wrh-6pvc-2jm9","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2wrh-6pvc-2jm9","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Improper rendering of text nodes in golang.org/x/net/html","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-3978","epss":0.00078,"percentile":0.24378,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.13.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.043289999999999995},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-3978","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3978","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/514896","https://go.dev/issue/61615","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1988","https://go.dev/cl/514896","https://go.dev/issue/61615","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1988"],"description":"Text nodes not in the HTML namespace are incorrectly literally rendered, causing text which should be escaped to not be.

Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files.

With fix, header parsing now correctly allocates only the memory required to hold parsed headers.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24534","epss":0.00045,"percentile":0.133,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.8","1.20.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.03375},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.10"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-24534","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.8,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"fc97b5cc1e0942e2","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.10","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/juju-wait-for","accessPath":"/bin/juju-wait-for","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.18.10","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.10","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"urllib3's request body not stripped after redirect from 303 status changes request method to GET","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45803","epss":0.00062,"percentile":0.1968,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.26.18"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.02852},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-45803","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45803","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/4e98d57809dacab1cbe625fddeec1a290c478ea9","https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/security/advisories/GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4R2Y5XK3WALSR3FNAGN7JBYV2B343ZKB/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5F5CUBAN5XMEBVBZPHFITBLMJV5FIJJ5/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PPDPLM6UUMN55ESPQWJFLLIZY4ZKCNRX/","https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-get","https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/4e98d57809dacab1cbe625fddeec1a290c478ea9","https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/security/advisories/GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4R2Y5XK3WALSR3FNAGN7JBYV2B343ZKB/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5F5CUBAN5XMEBVBZPHFITBLMJV5FIJJ5/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PPDPLM6UUMN55ESPQWJFLLIZY4ZKCNRX/","https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-get"],"description":"urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 301, 302, or 303 after the request had its method changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs. Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45803","epss":0.00062,"percentile":0.1968,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"1.26.15"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=0,<1.26.18 (python)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.26.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"5d01eb6f068f7dcd","name":"urllib3","version":"1.26.15","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.15.dist-info/METADATA","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.15.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.15.dist-info/RECORD","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.15.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.15.dist-info/top_level.txt","accessPath":"/lib/python3.10/site-packages/urllib3-1.26.15.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:urllib3:1.26.15:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/urllib3@1.26.15","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-39326","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39326","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/547335","https://go.dev/issue/64433","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/6ypN5EjibjM/m/KmLVYH_uAgAJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UIU6HOGV6RRIKWM57LOXQA75BGZSIH6G/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2382","https://go.dev/cl/547335","https://go.dev/issue/64433","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/6ypN5EjibjM/m/KmLVYH_uAgAJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UIU6HOGV6RRIKWM57LOXQA75BGZSIH6G/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2382"],"description":"A malicious HTTP sender can use chunk extensions to cause a receiver reading from a request or response body to read many more bytes from the network than are in the body.

The chunk reader now produces an error if the ratio of real body to encoded bytes grows too small.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39326","epss":0.00049,"percentile":0.15113,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.20.12","1.21.5"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.025234999999999997},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.10"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-39326","versionConstraint":"< 1.20.12,>= 1.21.0-0, < 1.21.5 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.20.12"}}],"artifact":{"id":"f071b12f18b018d9","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.10","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/juju-metadata","accessPath":"/bin/juju-metadata","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.18.10","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.10","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-jfmj-5v4g-7637","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jfmj-5v4g-7637","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"zipp Denial of Service vulnerability","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.2,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5569","epss":0.00042,"percentile":0.12193,"date":"2025-06-03"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.19.1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.023520000000000003},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-5569","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5569","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/jaraco/zipp/commit/fd604bd34f0343472521a36da1fbd22e793e14fd","https://huntr.com/bounties/be898306-11f9-46b4-b28c-f4c4aa4ffbae","https://github.com/jaraco/zipp/commit/fd604bd34f0343472521a36da1fbd22e793e14fd","https://huntr.com/bounties/be898306-11f9-46b4-b28c-f4c4aa4ffbae"],"description":"A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the jaraco/zipp library, affecting all versions prior to 3.19.1. The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted zip file that leads to an infinite loop. This issue also impacts the zipfile module of CPython, as features from the third-party zipp library are later merged into CPython, and the affected code is identical in both projects. The infinite loop can be initiated through the use of functions affecting the `Path` module in both zipp and zipfile, such as `joinpath`, the overloaded division operator, and `iterdir`. Although the infinite loop is not resource exhaustive, it prevents the application from responding. The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.19.1 of

Prior to 3.1.6, an oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment interacts with the |attr filter allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox.

When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not user the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigations.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37891","epss":0.00033,"percentile":0.08049,"date":"2025-06-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"1.26.15"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.26.19
